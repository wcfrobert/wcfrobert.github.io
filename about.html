        My name is Robert. Most people call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in California, currently working at 
        <a href="https://degenkolb.com/">Degenkolb Engineers</a>. I grew up in Toronto and I am Canadian. In 2018, I moved to the U.S to pursue my Master's degree in Structural Engineering at Stanford University. 
        Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Ottawa.

        In my spare time, I like to play tennis, rock climb, run, hike, and write/code on the internet. Check out my code here on <a href="https://github.com/wcfrobert">Github</a>, and check out my writing
        here in my <a href="musing.html">blogs</a>. I write about random things that interest me. The contents of all my work reflect my personal views only. I do these blog posts and programming projects in my spare time, 
        and I never write on behalf of my employer.
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Please reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
