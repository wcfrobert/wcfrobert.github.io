        My name is Robert. Most people call me Rob because it rolls off the tongue better. I grew up in Toronto, Canada. After finishing my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in 2018, I decided to fly across the continent for my MS degree in structural engineering at Stanford University. I was drawn to the West Coast in part by the allure of the Californian weather, as well the opportunity to learn from industry’s best and grow as an engineer. It has been a huge privilege to meet, and occasionally work with, some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world these past few years. I can’t be thankful enough.

        I am currently living in the Bay area as an engineer in training (recently passed the national PE exam). Hoping to eventually get my California SE license. My interest lies in nonlinear analysis, earthquake engineering, and adopting new computational methods/tools for structural analysis.

        This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new technology and boredom after work. Incidentally, it also quells my crushing need to be liked and remembered. I find calligraphy, and web design pretty cool too.

        As for the Californian weather. It is actually quite cold in the Bay Area (the coldest winter is summer in San Francisco). I now wear a light down jacket year-round. I've also taken a liking to hiking and rock-climbing since coming to California. My biggest hobby is still tennis! Always looking for new people to hit with. Pleased to meet you.
