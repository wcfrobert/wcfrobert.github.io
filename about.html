        Hi, my name is Robert. People tend to call me Rob or Bob. I was born in China but spent majority of my childhood in Toronto. After completing my Bachelor's degree in 2018, I moved to the West Coast to pursue my graduate studies at Stanford. It has been a huge privilege to work with some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world these past few years. I am so grateful for these amazing opportunities.

        I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California. My interest lies in nonlinear structural analysis, earthquake engineering, and adopting new computational methods/tools in structural engineering. This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new technologies and my crushing need to be liked. I find calligraphy, and web design pretty cool too.

        Bay Area is actually quite cold! (the coldest winter is summer in San Francisco) I now wear a light down jacket year-round. Quite predictably, I've also taken up hiking, rock-climbing, and grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Nevertheless, My number one hobby is, and always will be, tennis! Pleased to meet you!
