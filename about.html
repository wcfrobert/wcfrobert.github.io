        Hi, my name is Robert. People tend to call me Rob or Bob. I was born in China but spent majority of my childhood in Toronto. After completing my Bachelor's degree in 2018, I moved to the West Coast to pursue my graduate studies at Stanford. I graduated in 2020 with a Master's degree in Structural Engineering and I've resided in Northern California ever since. Aside from the perfect weather, I am so incredibly grateful to be working alongside some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world.

        I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California. My interests include: nonlinear structural analysis, earthquake engineering, and adopting new computational tools for structural engineering. This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new technologies and my crushing need to be liked. I find UI/UX, and web design pretty cool too.

        California has gotten the best of me. I've taken up hiking, rock-climbing, and grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Like Woody Allen in Annie Hall, I too order alfalfa sprouts and mashed yeast for lunch. Regardless of where I am, my number one hobby is and always will be tennis! Pleased to meet you!
