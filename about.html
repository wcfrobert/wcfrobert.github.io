    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Robert. Most people call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) currently practicing in the state of California. 
      I grew up in Toronto and I am Canadian. In 2018, I moved to the US to pursue my Master's degree and I've been here ever 
      since. My interests include structural engineering, programming, and design/typography. In other words, I like designing buildings, creating software, and making things look pretty. 
      In my spare time, I like to play tennis, rock-climb, run, hike, write prose, and write code. Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
