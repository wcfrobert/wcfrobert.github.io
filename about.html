    <h1>About Me</h1>

      <div style="min-width: 350px;">
        My name is Robert - most people call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in California, specializing in earthquake engineering and computational design.
        I currently work at Degenkolb Engineers, where I'm involved in seismic retrofits, new building design, computational tool development, data visualization, and various R&D initiatives.
        I have a master's degree in structural engineering from Stanford University, and a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Ottawa.
        <div style="margin-top: 1rem;"></div>
        I grew up in Toronto and I am Canadian. In 2018, I moved to the Bay Area for my master's degree and I've been here ever since. 
        My interests include structural analysis, programming, and design/typography. In other words, I like designing buildings, creating software, and making things look nice. 
        I am the creator of several popular structural engineering python packages. Most of which are open-source and publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/wcfrobert">my Github</a>. 
        Aside from coding, I also write occasional <a href="musing.html">blogs</a> on random things that interest me. The contents of this website reflect my personal views only. I do these blog posts and 
        programming projects in my spare time, and I never write on behalf of my employer. Outside of work, I like to play tennis, rock climb, run, hike, and write/code on the internet. Welcome to my little 
        corner of the internet. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
