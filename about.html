    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Robert. Most people call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California. My interests include structural analysis, earthquake engineering, and design (making things pretty). This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with stuff and my uncontrollable urge to muse about nonsense. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Aside from the perfect weather of Northern California, I am so incredibly grateful to be working alongside some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world. In my spare time, I like to play tennis, rock-climb, run, hike, write prose and write code. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Pleased to meet you!
