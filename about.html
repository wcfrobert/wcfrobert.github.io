        Hi, my name is Robert. People tend to call me Rob or Bob. I was born in China but spent majority of my childhood in Toronto. After completing my Bachelor's degree in 2018, I moved to the West Coast to pursue my graduate studies at Stanford. I graduated in 2020 with a Master's degree in Structural Engineering and I've resided in Northern California ever since. Aside from the perfect weather, I am so incredibly grateful to be working alongside some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world.

        I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California. My interests include: nonlinear structural analysis, earthquake engineering, and adopting/creating new computational tools for structural engineering. This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new technologies and my crushing need to be liked. I find UI/UX, and web design pretty compelling too.

        California has gotten the best of me. I took up hiking, rock-climbing, and grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Like Woody Allen, my go-to restaurant order is alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast. All jokes aside, regardless of where I am, my number one hobby will always be tennis! Pleased to meet you!
