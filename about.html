        My name is Robert. Most people call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) currently practicing in the state of California. 
        I grew up in Toronto and I am Canadian. In 2018, I moved to the US to pursue my Master's degree and I've been here ever 
        since. My interests include structural engineering, programming, and design/typography. In other words, I like designing buildings, creating software, and making things look nice. 
        In my spare time, I like to play tennis, rock-climb, run, hike, write prose, and write code. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Please reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.

    <h1>Favorite Books</h1>
    <p>
      I read mostly non-fiction. I enjoy books on history, business, psychology, productivity, self-help, and of course biographies. I read at a glacial pace of around 12 books a year. I envy
      those who can read 52 books a year while still keeping a full-time job.

    <h1>Favorite Movies</h1>
    <p>
      I keep a <a href="https://airtable.com/appILhm21eilQTsim/shro1eVbByPMzyoNE/tbl4Z3AVR3jiWfZ8z?viewControls=on">list</a> of every movies I've ever watched. Here are ten movies that really resonated with me. 
      In general, I am a fan of irony, humor, method acting, unconstrained creativity, and movies that are morally elevating. I am not a fan of mass market super hero sequals and remakes, nor do I enjoy arthouse nothingburger movies. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Whiplash</li>
      <li>Wall-E</li>
      <li>Little Miss Sunshine</li>
      <li>12 Angry Men</li>
      <li>Inception</li>
      <li>A Man Called Ove</li>
      <li>Inside Out</li>
      <li>The Matrix</li>
      <li>Forrest Gump</li>
      <li>The Shawshank Redemption</li>
    </ul>



    <h1>Favorite Quotes</h1>
    <p>
      Here are some quotes that I find profound. The thing about quotes - and wisdom in general - is that they tend to sound cliche, and are usually quite personal. It's difficult to appreciate an 
      insight until you acquire the requisite firsthand experience to internalize it. This is exactly why I think self-help book aren't as effective as they're made out to be. Someone could hand me the 
      secret to eternal happiness and health, and I'd probably brush it off as platitude - in the same way that my 16 year-old self would have scoffed at the quotes below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics" - G. H. Hardy</li>
      <li>"All models are wrong, but some are useful" - George Box</li>
      <li>"To add is expected, to subtract is design."</li>
      <li>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein</li>
      <li>"Education is the art of telling a series of decreasing lies."</li>
      <li>"Don't preach, narrate."</li>
      <li>"If It's worth doing, it's worth doing well."</li>
    </ul>
