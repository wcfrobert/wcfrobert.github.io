        My name is Robert. Most people call me Rob. I grew up in Toronto, Canada. I obtained my Bachelor's degree at The University of Ottawa in Civil Engineering in 2018. Afterwards, I traveled across the continent for my MS degree at Stanford University. I was drawn to the West Coast in part by the allure of the Californian weather, as well the opportunity to learn from industry’s best and grow as an engineer. It has been a huge privilege being able to meet, and occasionally work with, some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world these past few years. I can’t be thankful enough.

        I am currently living in the Bay area as an engineer in training (recently passed the national PE exam). Hoping to eventually get my California SE license. My interest lies in nonlinear analysis, earthquake engineering, and adopting new computational methods/tools for structural analysis.

        This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new things. It also quells my crushing need to be liked and remembered. I find calligraphy, and web design pretty cool too.

        As for the Californian weather. It is actually quite cold in the Bay Area (Mark Twain’s “coldest winter” is quite true). I now wear a light down jacket year-round. I've also taken a liking to hiking, rock-climbing, and eating arugula salad/poke bowls like a true Californian. My biggest hobby is still tennis! I’ve been a tennis player since I was nine years old. Always looking for new people to hit with. Pleased to meet you.
