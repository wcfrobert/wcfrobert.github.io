    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; gap: 15px; flex-wrap: wrap; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;">

      <div style="min-width: 350px; flex: 70;">
        My name is Robert. Most people call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in California, currently at 
        <a href="https://degenkolb.com/">Degenkolb Engineers</a>, where I work on seismic retrofits, new hospital design, computational tool development, data visualization, and various R&D initiatives.
        <br>
        <br>
        I grew up in Toronto and I am Canadian. In 2018, I moved to the U.S to pursue my Master's degree in Structural Engineering at Stanford University. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in 
        Civil Engineering from the University of Ottawa.
        <br>
        <br>
        My interests include structural engineering, programming, and design. 
        In my spare time, I like to play tennis, rock climb, run, hike, and write/code on the internet. I am the creator of several popular structural engineering python packages. Most of which are
        free, open-source, and available on my 
        <a href="https://github.com/wcfrobert">Github</a>.
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Please reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.

    <h1>Favorite Books</h1>
    <p>
      I read mostly non-fiction, with particular interest in biographies, history, psychology, business, and self-improvement through revealed preference. I read at a glacial pace - around 12 books a year - and I genuinely 
      envy those who manage to read 52 books a year while still juggling a full-time job. Here are some of my favorite books.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2024: Hackers and Painters - Paul Graham</li>
      <li>2023: Deep Work - Cal Newport</li>
      <li>2022: Peak - Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool</li>
      <li>2021: The Attention Merchant - Tim Wu</li>
      <li>2020: Steve Jobs - Walter Isaacson</li>
      <li>2019: Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari</li>
      <li>2018: The Paradox of Choice - Barry Schwartz</li>
      <li>2017: Quiet - Susan Cain</li>
      <li>2016: How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie</li>
    </ul>  

    <h1>Favorite Movies</h1>
    <p>
      I keep an <a href="https://airtable.com/appILhm21eilQTsim/shro1eVbByPMzyoNE/tbl4Z3AVR3jiWfZ8z?viewControls=on">ever-growing list</a> of every movies I have ever watched, each with a personal rating out of 10.
      In general, I am a fan of
      <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annie_hall"> witty humor</a>,
      <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moneyball"> engaging dialogues</a>,

      and movies that are <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_man_called_ove">morally elevating</a>. 
      I am not a fan of super hero sequels and remakes, nor do I enjoy arthouse nothingburger movies. Here are ten movies that I loved.

    <h1>Favorite Quotes</h1>
    <p>
      Quotes tend to be personal. One person's boring cliche is another's golden nugget of wisdom. I don't think it's possible to internalize an insight without the 
      requisite first-hand experience. I find the quotes below to be extremely profound. They capture some essence of truth and beauty (for me) in ways no other sequences of words can. Your mileage may vary. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics" - G. H. Hardy</li>
      <li>"All models are wrong, but some are useful" - George Box</li>
      <li>"To add is expected, to subtract is design."</li>
      <li>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein</li>
      <li>"If It's worth doing, it's worth doing well."</li>
    </ul>
