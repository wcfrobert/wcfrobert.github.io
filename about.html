        My name is Robert. People tend to call me Rob. I grew up in Toronto, Canada. After my Bachelor's degree, I moved across the continent to pursue my graduate studies at Stanford. It has been a huge privilege to meet and work with some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world these past few years. I am very thankful for these opportunities.

        I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California and I hope to eventually obtain my SE license. My interest lies in nonlinear structural analysis, earthquake engineering, and adopting new computational methods/tools. This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new technologies and perhaps sheer boredom. Incidentally, it also quells my crushing need to be liked and remembered. I find calligraphy, and web design pretty cool too.

        It is actually quite cold in the Bay Area (the coldest winter is summer in San Francisco). I now wear a light down jacket year-round; predictably, I've also taken a liking to hiking and rock-climbing. My number one hobby is still tennis though! Pleased to meet you!
