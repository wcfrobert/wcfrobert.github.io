        Hi, my name is Robert. People tend to call me Rob or Bob. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California. My interests include nonlinear structural analysis, earthquake engineering, and creating/adopting new computational tools. This website is the byproduct of my love for tinkering with new technologies and my crushing need to be liked.

        I am currently practicing in Northern California. Aside from the perfect weather, I am so incredibly grateful to be working alongside some of the best engineers, professors, and researchers in the world. In my spare time, I play tennis, rock-climb, run, hike, and write prose (or code) depending on how I'm feeling. Pleased to meet you!
