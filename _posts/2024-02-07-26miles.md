## "Remember the Athenians"

Two thousand and five hundred years ago, Athens made a fateful decision to send military forces to cities in Ionia to support their attempt to overthrow Persian Rule. This event - known to history as the Ionian Revolt - absolutely infuriated the King of the Achaemenid Persian Empire: Darius the Great. He concluded that the Greek city-states on the other side of the Aegean Sea were threats to the stability of the his Empire. Thus, he vowed to conquer the whole of Greece, and burn Athens to the ground.

For the next 3 years until the first Persian invasion in 490 BC, Darius supposedly had his servant say "Master, remember the Athenians" three times a day before dinner. Legend has it that Darius shot an arrow to the sky and uttered:

> "Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians"



## The Battle of Marathon

The subjugation of Greece seemed inevitable. The Achaemenid Persian Empire at its peak was unfathomably rich, and its territorial expanse so vast that it stretch from Egypt all the way to the borders of India. The empire included a diverse array of cultures, languages, and people. It has been said that the Persian army was so large that it "drank the rivers dry" wherever it went.

Yet somehow the Athenians prevailed. 

The Battle of Marathon was a watershed moment. It greatly boosted Greek morale, and showed the other Greek city-states that the Persians were not invincible, that they can in fact be beaten. Legend has it that after the battle, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides ran 26 miles to Athens, where he announced to the people: "We've won!" then promptly collapsed and died*.

## My Battle With The Marathon

Compared to the painting, you'll notice more clothes, less crowd, and likely equal amount of pain.

When I finished my first half-marathon last year, I felt great exhilaration and an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. When I finished my first marathon this past Sunday, all I felt was pain. 

It's been 3 days and I am still so sore. I can't even think of anything inspirational to say because I am so tired. The whole thing was god awful. I was aiming to finish within 5 hours, but I started to cramp at 21 miles. I more or less limped the last 5 miles. When I eventually crossed the finish line, most of the crowds have dissipated. I barely got my photos taken because the camera man was getting ready to pack up. I placed 190th out of 200 in my age group; 1400th out of 1500 overall. Terrible results i know... but at least I finished within the cutoff time.

I severely underestimated the mileage and time commitment required to properly train for a marathon. I was only running three times a week, topping out at 30 miles per week with my longest run being 16 miles. Even with my terrible training regiment - which I followed on-and-off for about 3 months - it was still a lot of running, and it took time away from other things I enjoy like climbing or tennis. Honestly, I am just happy to be done with all this running. I still plan to run occasional 5ks, but I don't see myself doing another full marathon for the foreseeable future. Kudos to those who run marathon all the time. You guys are nuts!

*Note: The well-known Marathon origin story mentioned above is actually not accurate. Pheidippides did run a lot, but he was sent from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance <u>before</u> the battle started. In total, he covered a distance of 140 miles in two days. Pheidippides' travel to Sparta is conflated with how the Athenian army marched ~25 miles back to Athens at a very high pace after the battle.
