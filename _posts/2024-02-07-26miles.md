## "Remember the Athenians"

Two thousand and five hundred years ago, the Greek city-state of Athens sent their military force across the Aegean Sea. Their goal was to support Ionia cities in their attempt to overthrow Persian Rule. The rebellion - known to history as the Ionian Revolt - provoked the wrath of Darius the Great; King of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.

He began to see the whole of Greece as a destabilizing force that must be eradicated. For the next 3 years until the first Persian invasion in 490 BC, Darius supposedly had his servant say "Master, remember the Athenians" three times a day before dinner. When the invasion began, Darius supposedly shot an arrow to the sky and uttered:

> "Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians"



## The Battle of Marathon

The subjugation of Greece seemed inevitable. The Persian Empire was unfathomably rich. Its territorial expanse was so vast that it stretch from Egypt all the way to the borders of India. The empire included a diverse array of cultures, languages, and people. It has been said that the Persian army was so large that it "drank the rivers dry" wherever it went.

Yet the Athenians prevailed. 

The Victory at Marathon was a watershed moment. It kept Persia out of mainland Greece for 10 years, and greatly boosted Greek morale. The battle of Marathon showed the Greeks that the Persians were not invincible, that they can be defeated. Legend has it that after the battle, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides ran 26 miles to Athens, where he announced to the people: "We've won!" then promptly collapsed and died of exhaustion*.

## My Battle With The Marathon

The race started off great! But at the 21 mile mark, my quads gave out and I started to get terrible cramps. I more or less limped the last 5 miles. When I eventually dragged myself across the finish line, most of the crowds have dissipated. The nearby tumbleweed wafted across the pavement at twice my speed like some kind of cruel joke. I closed my eyes to savor the moment/pain. The only thing I hear was Pitbull (AKA Mr. World Wide) blaring on the speaker which only made the pain worse. After I've stabilized myself emotionally, I opened my eyes and saw the camera man getting ready to pack up. No! If I don't get my photo for Insta, all of this would have been for naught. With incredible dexterity and a pace faster than my entire marathon, I lepted towards the photographer and asked for a photo. Anyways, long story short, I placed 190th out of 200 in my age group; 1400th out of 1500 overall. 

Here's a photo of me at the finish line. Compared to the painting above , you'll notice more clothes, less crowd, and probably equal amount of pain.

When I finished my first half-marathon last year, I felt great exhilaration and an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. When I finished my first marathon this past Sunday, all I felt was pain and maybe a sense of relief. It's been 3 days and I am still so sore. I can't even think of anything inspirational to say here. Follow your dreams! Even if they happen to be nightmares.

*Footnote:*

**The Marathon origin story above is actually not accurate. Pheidippides ran a lot more than a marathon, he was sent from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance before the battle started. In total, he covered a distance of 140 miles in two days. Pheidippides' travel to Sparta is conflated with how the Athenian army marched ~25 miles back to Athens at a very high pace immediately after the battle.*
