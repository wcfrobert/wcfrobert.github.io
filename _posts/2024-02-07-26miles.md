## "Remember the Athenians"

Two thousand and five hundred years ago, Athens, along with some other Greek city-states, decided to send military forces to Ionian cities in support of their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. This event became known to history as the Ionian Revolt. The rebellion infuriated Darius the Great; King of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. He began to see the Greek city-states on the other side of the Aegean Sea as threats to the stability of the his Empire. Thus, he vowed to conquer the whole of Greece, and burn Athens to the ground.

For the next 3 years until the first Persian invasion of Greece in 490 BC, Darius supposedly had his servant say "Master, remember the Athenians" three times a day before dinner. Legend has it that Darius shot an arrow to the sky and uttered:

> "Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians"



## The Battle of Marathon

The Achaemenid Persian Empire at its peak was so vast that it stretched from the borders of Greece all the way to India, its army was so big that wherever they went, they "drank the rivers dry". The subjugation of Greece seemed inevitable. 

Yet somehow the Athenians prevailed. The Battle of Marathon was a watershed moment. It showed the Greeks that the Persians are not invincible, that they can in fact be beaten.

Legend has it that after the battle, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides ran 26 miles to Athens, where he announced to the people: "We've won!" then promptly collapsed and died of exhaustion*.

## My Battle With The Marathon

Compared to the painting above, you'll notice more clothes, less crowd, and likely equal amount of pain.

* One word to describe my emotion after my half-marathon: **Elation**
* One word to describe my emotion after my marathon: **Relief**

The whole thing was god awful. I was aiming to finish within 5 hours, but at mile 21, I started to get bad cramps in my quads. I more or less limped the last 5 miles. When I crossed the finish line, most of the crowds have dissipated. I barely got my photos taken because the camera man was getting ready to pack up. I placed 190th out of 200 in my age group; 1400th out of 1500 overall. Terrible results, but I couldn't care less. At least I finished within the cutoff time.

It's been 3 days since the marathon and I am still so sore. I can't even think of anything inspirational to write because I am so tired. I severely underestimated the mileage and time commitment required to properly train for a marathon... I under-trained with only 3 runs a week, topping out at 30 mile/week at the peak. Even with my terrible training regimen, running was taking away time from things I enjoyed such as climbing and tennis. 

Honestly, I am just happy to be done with all this running. I still plan to run occasional 5ks, but I don't see myself doing another full marathon for the foreseeable future. Kudos to those who runs marathon routinely. You guys are nuts!

*Note: The popular Marathon origin story mentioned above is actually not true... Pheidippides did run a lot, but he was sent from Athens to Sparta to ask for assistance <u>before</u> the battle started. In total, he covered a distance of 140 miles in two days. Pheidippides' travel to Sparta is conflated with how the Athenian army marched ~25 miles back to Athens at a very high pace after the battle, carrying heavy armor and with great post-battle fatigue.
