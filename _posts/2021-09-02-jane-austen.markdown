## Sense and Sensitivity

**2025-08-09 Update**: I've been duped. The paperback version of this book I bought on Amazon was fake! Not just the regular fake with low-quality paper and weird typesetting, the version I have appeared to be shortened, and completely different from Jane Austen's original work! To add insult to injury, the book is available [online for free](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/161/old/sense11p.pdf). Instead of printing the novel which is available in the public domain, the scammers decided to print some shitty abridged version. I've since deleted the original blog post. I will update it again once I've read the actual Jane Austen classic. 

Be careful what you buy on Amazon... For what it's worth, I consider myself a savvy shopper, and I never buy anything below 4 stars, nor anything not on the first page of my search query. It was not obvious when I made the purchase back in 2019. You can't entirely trust the reviews either given the prevalence of [brand and review hijacking](https://www.kleinbottle.com/Amazon_Brand_Hijacking.html).
