I had an interesting thought today while watching some C# tutorial on Udemy. You know the phrase: "Don't run before you can walk"? Its meant to warn against doing something too advanced before you can do something simpler. To put it another way, have a solid foundation. Overstretching your capacity can dangerous. 

I think the proverb is generally true, but perhaps not fully true in this rapidly advancing world of ours. With the advent of powerful search engines, and Q&A forums, it is perhaps appropriate to append another phrase:

> "Don't run before you can walk; but try to fly as soon as you can run"

## Upskilling In The 21st Century

Peter Drucker, the famous management theorist, once noted the necessity and importance of life-long learning:

> "The only skill that will be important in the 21st century is the skill of learning new skills. Everything else will become obsolete over time" - Peter Drucker

This message is perhaps most salient in the software engineering world. Tech stacks are constantly evolving. It seems like a new Javascript library is born every couple of weeks. Although some fundamental skills are transferable and evergreen, there will inevitably be skills that are not. Programmers are finding themselves in a constant need to learn new things, and keep up with the latest trends. 

In the programming tutorial circle, there is a concept known as **"Tutorial Hell"**. It's a phenomenon where you watch one tutorial after another, without ever building something on your own. Although following step-by-step tutorials seem productive, the learning rate is **linear** and eventually tapers off. 

Most learning comes from trial and error. Imagine trying to learn a new language like Spanish. Yes, Duolingo may be helpful in the beginning, but eventually you would need to immerse yourself in the language. Speak Spanish to other people, listen to Spanish podcasts, watch Spanish films, read Spanish articles. In other words, following tutorial is necessary, but not sufficient.

This brings me to my point! There was a time before the internet when the only source of learning comes from textbooks or university classes. If you ever run into a problem, you need to physically go to a library, and flip through volumes of textbooks. If you are lucky enough, there would be a subject matter expert you can reach and ask questions. 

In the modern world, equipped with tools like Google and StackOverflow, we should aim for **exponential** rate of learning! As soon as you have enough foundation for the basics (i.e. you can walk), immediately try to building something on your own (i.e. try to fly!). 

No need to worry about flying too close to the sun! You have access to thousands of experts just a few keystrokes away. What a time to be alive!
