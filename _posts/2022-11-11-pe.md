As of November 10, 2022, I am officially a licensed Professional Engineer in the state of California!

It is a feat that I could have only dreamed of a few short years ago. Now that once-distant dream has come true. I feel.... just meh. Perhaps a bit relieved because I never have to see another horizontal curve question ever again. 

I think my apathy is the product of my environment. Literally everyone around me has their PE license, so it's only natural that I get mine. In fact, I could have gotten my PE back in April of this year. What took so long? I guess I am doomed to only look uphill. Still so much to do! So much to learn! Many more mountains to climb! Next step: passing the SE exam.

Nevertheless, I recognize that this is a notable career milestone. Reflecting back on my first quarter of life, there were several key people who played a vital role in my life. For better or worse, they made me into the person I am today! Subtracting any one and my life trajectory changes completely!

* My parents - For their unwavering love and support
* DF & JF - For fostering my life-long love in tennis
* F.R - For being my first friend in a foreign country
* C.X - For being my best friend/mentor and my North Star
* B.M.P - For showing me the beauty of engineering
* G.D - For giving me the confidence to believe that I am good enough to be a Stanford student
* G.L - For showing me what it means to be a good engineer
* J.H and W.L - For the amazing career opportunities. For trusting me more than I trust myself
* J.X - For helping me understand myself

I cannot be more grateful for these people! Thank you to everyone else I've ever worked with!

Now, where is my lambo!?
