*Figure: Landscape with Fall of Icarus by Pieter Bruegel the Elder*

Looking at the painting above, at first glance, your attention may be drawn to the nondescript farmer plowing the land, or a shepherd with his dog herding sheep, or the vast ocean with majestic ships, or the towns and mountains in the distance. 

Upon second glance, you might notice something deeply strange and upsetting. In the lower right corner, a man appears to be have fallen into the ocean, most likely about to drown with both legs desperately flailing about. This seemingly innocuous painting actually depicts one of the most well-known event in Greek mythology: the fall of Icarus.

In Greek mythology, Icarus long dreamed of flying and escaping the island of Crete. His father, a master craftsman, built him a pair of wings made from feather and wax. Before giving the wings to Icarus, he warned him of two dangers: one of complacency, and one of hubris. By flying too low, the wings could potentially collect moisture from the ocean and clog. By flying too high, the heat of the sun might melt the wax holding the feathers together. Not heeding his father's warning, Icarus "flew too close to the sun" as the saying goes, and fell tragically to his death.

Yet as we look at the painting, the death of Icarus is not what one immediately notices. In fact, without knowing the title of the painting beforehand, it is quite plausible that one might miss the small disturbance in the lower right corner. The fateful death of Icarus, this tragic fate of mythical proportions, is but part of the backdrop to some farmers working the land. It is painted no bigger the sheep that roams the hills, given no particular emphasis as to be completely unremarkable and easily missed. Perhaps that is the perfect analog to all of life's trials and tribulations, and to our daily inner turmoil. 

## Liberating or Depressing?

Despite the absolute severity of the situation - and to Icarus - the last few seconds of his life, the farmer continues to plow, completely unware of an imminent death. The world appears to move on dispassionately with or without Icarus.

Depending on your perspective, this painting can be either incredibly liberating, or deeply depressing. It is a cruel and humbling reminder that no matter how big or small a problem we are currently faced with, no matter how critical its resolution might seem to us, at the end of the day, nobody else cares. It doesn't matter whether you are at a critical cross-road of your life, or the absolute depth of your misery, or the acme of your achievements, the world is utterly apathetic.

You can choose to read this painting many ways, and it brings up some deeply philosophical questions; one that might tend towards nihilism if one is not careful. However, I choose to interpret this artwork as profoundly liberating; mostly because of my risk aversion, and my once debilitating preoccupation for how others perceive me. By understanding that I am my worst critic, and that those hundreds of embarrassing things I've done are remembered by no one else but me, I feel 100 lbs lighter.
