## Movie Nights

I've been on a movie-watching spree recently; indulging in at least two films a week. What spurred on this questionable lack of temperance was my purchase of a $800 BenQ projector. I have it set up in my living room and I've since debated the merit of ever going to a movie theater again! A 70" screen right in my living room? What a wonderful purchase! Although it did cost me a pretty penny... 

The frugal side of me is appalled by what appears to be an act of financial suicide. I could have invested the $800 into my Roth retirement account which is post-tax and by the power of compounding assuming 6% annual return on an SP500 index fund, 2% inflation, withdrawal after 60 to avoid tax penalty, not exceeding annual contribution limit, blah blah blah. You get the point. I guess no more avocado toast and Starbucks coffee for me for the next year. 

Moreover, I don't have Netflix or any other streaming subscriptions. I don't think I will ever get one. Instead, I rent my films online at a cost of around $4 per movie. Ridiculous I know... The goal is to be more intentional with what I watch. I guess I value my attention more than the cost-efficiency of a streaming subscription.

I've been going through item by item the "top 100 greatest film of all time". Films across many different genres; from the American fantasy classic "Wizard of Oz" to the epic gangster flick "Goodfellas". Out of all the amazing films I've watched this year, one really stood out. Quite unexpectedly it was a "comedy" film; a "tragicomedy" film to be exact. At the end of the film, I was crying with a huge grin on my face.

## Little Miss Sunshine

"Little Miss Sunshine" is about a borderline-dysfunctional family in Albuquerque going on a road trip to California to compete in a child beauty pageant. Along the way, a whole slew of unfortunate events befell the Hoover family. Nothing goes right for them. There was the death of a dream, a love, a career, potentially a marriage. I mean (spoiler alert) the grandpa literally dies... Despite the slings and arrows of life's outrageous fortune, and the unquestionably tragic story arcs, the Hoover family prevails with quite a heartwarming and uplifting ending. 

Somehow, the directors managed to turn this modern day "Candide" into a comedy film that the whole family can enjoy. Unlike Voltaire's Candide which attacks the idea of philosophical optimism, "Little Miss Sunshine" highlights the trap of taking oneself too seriously, and the absurdity of the inner turmoil we willingly subject ourselves through in the name of some senseless competition. 

The impetus of the script actually came from a Arnold Schwarzenegger quote. While speaking to a group of high school students, Schwarzenegger reportedly said "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers. I despise them." Following reading this quote from a newspaper, Michael Arndt took to the pen. To quote the Michael Arndt:

> "And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude ... I wanted to ... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down ... So to a degree, a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through."

Here is the list of characters and a bit more about what they went through.

* Richard Hoover (Father) - The unsuccessful father who's working hard to build a career as a motivational speaker. Ironically, he sells self-help CDs which promise a fail-proof 7-step guide to success. He is struggling to keep his family's finance afloat. During the road trip, we witness the final nail in the coffin for his business when another publisher declines a publishing deal and questions his entire self-help approach.
* Sheryl Hoover (Mother) - The overworked mother of two who's doing the best she can. However, her marriage with Richard is in a tenuous situation and the family is on the borderline of financial ruin.
* Dwayne Hoover (Brother) - A skinny, lanky, Nietzsche-reading teenager filed with angst. He sees his family member as losers and took an oath to not utter a single word until he accomplishes his goal of becoming a fighter pilot. His oath of silence, which lasted several months, was broken during the road trip when he found out he was color-blind. Color-blindness effectively disqualifies him from ever becoming a pilot. 
* Edwin Hoover (Grandpa) - Richard's father who was recently evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin and now lives with the family. He is at an old age and does not care about anything anymore.
* Frank Ginsberge (Uncle) - A Proust scholar who became unemployed after saying some regrettable things after losing the love of his life to an academic competitor. He tried to commit suicide but was saved at the last minute. The Hoover family was assigned to take care of him and aid in his recovery as he has no where else to go.
* Olive Hoover (Daughter) - The innocent daughter of the Hoover family. She qualified for the "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant in California and is super excited to go. She represents the small shred of innocents and hope that the Hoover family still has as they trudge on towards California in a half-broken van.



## And The Winner is...

I won't bore you with the details of the road trip, it is a long series of misfortune; one after the other. In the end, they arrived at the competition with the door on the van literally falling off. They run into the hotel where the competition is being held to quickly discover that this is not Albuquerque anymore. 

As they watch the young girls, barely old enough for elementary school, get their hair done in the most outrageous fashion, put on makeups, fake eye lashes, spray-on sun tan, they quickly realize the absurdity of it all. In short, they blow off some steam and make an utter fool of themselves. After being banned for life from participating in another Little Miss Sunshine pageant ever again, they go back to their van, pushes it forward (as the van is so broken at this point that the engine cannot start without a running start) and heads back home grinning ear to ear, laughing at the absurdity of it all.

Despite the fact that the movie ends on a positive, uplifting note. Objectively speaking, none of their circumstances are any better. The family is still on the verge of financial ruin; the marriage is still tenuous; the father's self-help business remains unsuccessful; the grandpa remains dead; the brother is still disqualified from ever becoming a pilot; the uncle still lost the love of his life. 

However the one thing that did change was their attitude. The ending reminded me of the myth of Sisyphus. Sisyphus was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity; but he was not condemned to dread doing it. As Camus puts it: one must imagine Sisyphus smiling. For in the grand scheme of things, many of the things we lose sleep over is just as trivial, just as ridiculous as the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.
