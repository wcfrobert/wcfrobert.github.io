*"Primer" is a personal reference notebook and a side project where I can organize and digest some of the things I've learned on the job. The goal is to be concise, and hopefully useful when I take the SE exam. Code documents and design guides are meant to be information dense. These articles help me organize information and condense my thoughts.*

*Please note that these notes are for my own use. It is not peer-reviewed and was most likely written late Thursday night after a long day of work. Reader discretion is advised (in fact reading discouraged). No warranty is expressed or implied by me on the validity of the information presented herein.*

Connection design can be done in either ASD (Allowable Stress Design) or LRFD (Load Resistance Factored Design). This document will be exclusively in LRFD. 
* Capacity is denoted by a $$\phi$$ factor and subscript "r" (e.g. $$\phi P_n$$)
* Demand is denoted by subscript "u". (e.g. $$P_u$$)


ACI 318 is exclusively based on LRFD (Load and Resistance Factored Design).
* Capacity is denoted by a $$\phi$$ factor and subscript "n" (e.g. $$\phi P_n$$)
* Demand is denoted by subscript "u". (e.g. $$P_u$$)

The basis of all design checks is to ensure a DCR (Demand-Capacity Ratio) of less than 1.0:

$$Capacity > Demand \tag 9$$

$$ \phi T_n > T_u \tag {10}$$

$$DCR = \frac{demand}{capacity} = \frac{T_u}{\phi T_n} < 1.0 \tag {11}$$
