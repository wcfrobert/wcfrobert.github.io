## Meal Kit Delivery?

Back in January, I started using this subscription meal kit service called "HelloFresh". In essence, each week they deliver to you a box of groceries and recipe cards; thus saving you from a grocery trip and finding the right ingredients. With the promotion, Each serving is about 8 dollars, I think the non-promotion price is around 11 dollars per meal. Some people might find that expensive, but It's actually a lot cheaper than my usual spending habits where I spend at least 30 dollars a day on take out. I find that at least for me, "HelloFresh" forces me to switch up my diet and try different type of cuisine. I am trying to eat healthy this year.

Since everything is pre-packaged, I find that I am also wasting a lot less food than I normally would. No more unnecessary stress of worrying about food going bad in the fridge.

The only con I see right now is the time it takes to cut, cook, and clean. I honestly find cutting and cooking kind of entertaining, but I absolutely dread dish-cleaning. Since I only have a few plates and cutleries, it doesn't make sense to use the dish-washer for 2 plates and a fork. 

I find it amusing to make a meal and then take some nice photos of it. Thus came to fruition my HelloFresh album. Overtime, I thought to myself "why not add some commentary and make it a blog post?" Perhaps someone out there might find it useful.

I will be using a 5-star rating system with two of the most important parameters I consider in any meal: taste and convenience.

| **Stars** | **Taste** |
| - | - |
| 1/5 | Why is this a thing? |
| 2/5 | Edible |
| 3/5 | On par |
| 4/5 | Looking forward to eating it |
| 5/5 | I don't mind having this everyday |
