## Preface: To Try

Roughly four or five years ago, a 19-page pdf document changed my life. It was an essay composition guide written by Jordan Peterson for one of his classes at University of Toronto. The document was being passed around within the self-improvement circles online and it was generating a lot of buzz. I still have it and I still read it every once in a while. (<a href="/assets/Essay Guide by Jordan Peterson.pdf">Download Link</a>).

> "Don’t ever underestimate the power of words. Without them, we would still be living in trees. When you [write] an essay, you are harnessing the full might of culture to your life. [Even if you think you] are doing something stupid, trivial and dull, [remember,] you are conquering the unknown."

It wasn't so much his advice on <u>how</u> to write an essay that left such a profound impact on me, I find his methods overly mechanical and rigid for my style anyways. Instead, it was his advice on <u>why</u> one should write essays that is positively edifying.

The word "essay" originates from the French verb "essayer", which means to try. Therefore, the act of writing an essay is to attempt - with the best of one's ability - to explore some topic of interest. For most of our lives, we write because we are compelled to by a teacher or a professor, for the sake of demonstrating some competency in some subject matter. However, the true reward of writing extends far beyond passing some course and eventually getting your diploma. Without any doubt in my mind, learning to write is the most important skill one can acquire. Why?

**To write is to think**. To write is to exercise your ability in idea formulation and organization. Through writing, we turn incoherent, jumbled thoughts into coherent, informed, and sophisticated set of ideas about something we find important. There is no substitute for the writing process. There can be no thought without expression, no content without form. Whatever profound ideas you may have in your head, they simply don't exist until you can write them down.

Writing also improves your ability to make cogent arguments, organize thoughts on the fly, and communicate effectively. It clarifies your thinking and gives you an efficient mind, one that is grounded and well-trained to spot bad ideas and fallacious thinking. In short, it makes you a formidable individual no matter what professional endeavor you choose to undertake.

> "Consider your success over the course of a lifetime. Here is something to think about: the person who can formulate and communicate the best argument almost always wins. If you want a job, you have to make a case for yourself. If you want a raise, you have to convince someone that you deserve it. If you are trying to convince someone of the validity of your idea, you have to debate its merits successfully."

> "If you sharpen your capacity to think and to communicate as a consequence of writing, you are better armed. The pen is mightier than the sword, as the saying goes. This is no cheap cliché. Ideas change the world, particularly when they are written."

But writing isn't just some Nietzschen Will to Power. Being able to write well means you'll be more resilient to the hardships that comes with the vicissitudes of life. By putting feeling into words, you bring clarity to your mind, and in turn you will be less ailed by unnecessary stress and vague emotional irritations.

Lastly and most importantly, learning to write hones our ability to think critically, the want of which in a populace would most certainly be the end to a functioning democracy. I hate to use an adage from Star Wars, but it is most certainly true. Democracies don't die in darkness; they die with thunderous applause from wits who don't know any better.

So write! And teach others to write! Protect yourself from superstitious beliefs, foolish fads, and dangerous ideologies. Equip yourself with the ability to differentiate between good ideas intelligently presented, and bad ideas put forth by conspiracy theorist, populist demagogues, and unskilled thinkers. Write as if your way of life depends on it, as if the healthy functioning of your society depends on it, for they most certainly do. 

## The Danger of ChatGPT

With all of that as preface, let's move on to the topic that's been generating a lot of buzz in the media lately: ChatGPT. Specifically, I want to talk about it in the context of writing.

*Excerpt From Yann Lecunn's Linkedin Post on Large Language Models like ChatGPT*

The snip above is from a viral LinkedIn post from world-renowned AI researcher Yann Lecunn. In the post, he is evidently trying to curb the recent hype in LLMs, and to downplay the perceived utility of ChatGPT. But the one thing he does not downplay is how ChatGPT could be useful as "a writing aid". I find this fact deeply worrying and unsettling.

In case you've never used ChatGPT before, it works like this: you give the AI your main arguments in bullet point form, then the AI is capable of generating proses, paragraphs, to entire essays in any style you want within seconds. You can write a short story, a haiku, a Shakespearean sonnet, a piece of investigative journalism, a high school book report, a business email, etc. If you don't like the first generated draft, you can keep "chatting" with the AI to continually refine what was written previously. With this tool, you can conceivably write an essay on incredibly complex topics like a dissection of Simone De Beauvoir's Ethics of Ambiguity in minutes, rather than hours plus however long it took to do your research - that is if you didn't use ChatGPT to do your research in the first place.

I am not worried in the "AI will take my job" kind of way, nor in the "I am a luddite and I oppose all change" kind of way. I am worried because these tools are just too fucking good. They have the potential to fundamentally change <u>how</u> we think and by extension what it means to be human. 

Why ride a horse when you can drive a car? Why do arithmetic in your head when you can use a calculator? The universal theme of past technological advancements is reducing our physical/cognitive load and the drudgeries therein so we can "focus on more interesting things". But these technological advancements are highly specific. Nothing cuts quite as deep and as wide as the large language model. What happens if we reduce the need to <u>think</u> itself? Writing (and by extension thinking) comes in two parts: the generation of ideas, and the organization of jumbled thoughts into something more coherent and structured. Is the second step really inconsequential enough to be skipped? Maybe it is just more efficient to communicate in bullet point form. Maybe our current means of communication is too high latency anyways. I really don't  know. How long until we needn't think at all? Will our public discourse eventually happen in bullet point form too? As imprecise and disorganized stream of thoughts with a 280 character limit? Like the inconsequential chirp of birds? Wait ....

Another concern I have about these tools is how easy and low friction they make it for students to cheat. When I was in college, I occasionally get ads for essay-writing services on social media. I've always found those ads to embody the utter degradation of our education system and misalignment of priorities. During our four years of college, our sole purpose in life is to learn, to think, and to learn to think. How ridiculously counter-productive it is to forego the only responsibility you have at that age and nerf yourself? Why spend money to guarantee a direct path to mediocrity. But we live in the age of LLMs now, a student can press a few keystrokes and have an entire essay written for them, for free, in seconds. I don't think I would have been able to handle that kind of temptation in my foolish youth (even worse than now). <u>But here is the real conundrum</u>: Notwithstanding some moral/philosophical argument, from a purely economic/practical standpoint, is it really "cheating"? Students will most certainly have access to these tools when they enter the workplace. This is such a galactic size paradigm shift. I don't see how humanity can remain the same going forward.

I prefer to think of myself as a technologist and the quintessential early adopter/tinkerer. The recent advancement in AI is nothing short of freaking amazing! I am constantly blown away by the quality (and dare I say creativity) of arts generated by tools like DALL.E and midjourney. And I hardly need to express how breathtaking ChatGPT is. I'm sure these tools will provide productivity boost on a level we can't yet comprehend. If this is really just the beginning of an AI explosion, then we are surely headed towards an exciting albeit turbulent decade. Yet when I think of the concurrent explosion of online misinformation, and our already frayed public discourse, my excitement quickly turns into unease.

*Disclaimer: I suddenly have the need to say this blog post was written without the use of ChatGPT nor any other LLMs. I don't think I ever will at least for these blog posts. That would be utterly counter-productive. It would be like running on the treadmill while eating a big mac. I would certainly lose more than I gain. (I guess in the context of this analogy, I would gain more than I lose... Anyways, you get the point)*
