I've always been a fan of Walter Isaacson's biographies. In fact, my favorite biography - perhaps my favorite book period - is his biography on Steve Jobs which I read back in 2018. I recently picked up another one of his best-selling biography on the renaissance polymath Leonardo Da Vinci. It was quite the page turner. There were so many points in the book where I was left completely gobsmacked by Leonardo's absolute brilliance! Snippets of Leonardo's notebook can be found throughout the book and they were delightful every time.
