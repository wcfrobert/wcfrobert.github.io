It has been a while since my last blog post. What's with the one-and-a-half month hiatus? You might ask. Well, my imaginary audience, I promise I was not slacking off! Instead of writing prose, I was writing code! After almost two years, I finally found some time to finish up my [finite-element program in python](https://github.com/wcfrobert/fapp). I also made significant headway on several other programming side-projects. More to come in the coming months! But my immense productivity in programming comes with a cost. I only have finite number of hours each day afterall. Throughout the month of February and March, I was not reading as much, and I certainly was not writing blog posts.

It's quite interesting! I get the sense that writing code and writing prose uses opposite sides of my brain. Programming is highly analytical and precise (left hemisphere), whereas writing is highly creative but imprecise (right hemisphere). The problem is I don't feel like my pie is getting any bigger. There seems to be a zero-sum tradeoff where practicing programming inevitably degrades my writing ability, and vice versa. Maybe I'm wrong. Not sure.

Major update. I ran a half marathon! If you recall from a [blog post last October](https://robwang.io/blog/2022/10/26/hiatus.html), I had the idea of maybe running a half-marathon. But I hate running, and I never thought I'd actually go through with it. What an incredible confidence boost to manifest an idea into reality. Crossing that finish line on February 5th was one of the happiest day of my life!

I still dread running, but I enjoy the feeling after a run, and I love what running represents: a constant  process of self-improvement; to take one step at a time even though your entire body is aching, and it's questioning why you need to run so much in the 21st century. 

Words cannot capture the sheer exhileration during the last mile of the race. The many months of grueling training was all for this moment. With complete strangers cheering me on, the adrenaline and the atmosphere drove me into a frenzy. I was running as fast as I could, my heart felt like it was going to explode, and my legs were begging me to stop, but I kept going. One leg after the other just like the training. The experience was simply unforgettable. I was tired, I was relieved, I was grateful, I was overjoyed, most importantly, I felt alive.
