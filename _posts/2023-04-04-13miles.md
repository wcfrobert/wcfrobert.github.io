## Writing Prose and Writing Code

It has been a while since my last post. What's with the two month hiatus? Well, my imaginary audience, instead of writing prose, I was writing code! I made significant progress on several programming side-projects of mine, including my [FEM program in python](https://github.com/wcfrobert/fapp). More to come in the coming months! But my immense productivity in programming comes at a cost. After all, I only have finite number of hours each day. Throughout the month of February and March, I was not reading as much as I could have, and I certainly was not writing blog posts.

It's quite interesting! I get the sense that writing code and writing prose engages opposite sides of my brain. Programming is highly analytical and precise, whereas writing is highly creative but imprecise. The problem is I don't think my pie is getting any bigger. There seems to be a zero-sum struggle between the left and right hemisphere of my brain; where practicing programming inevitably degrades my writing ability, and vice versa. 

## Huntington Beach Marathon 2023

Another major update. I ran a half marathon back in February! If you recall from a [blog post last October](https://robwang.io/blog/2022/10/26/hiatus.html), I had the idea of maybe running a half-marathon, but I've always hated running, and I never thought I'd actually go through with it. What an incredible confidence boost to manifest that idea into reality. Crossing the finish line on February 5th was one of the happiest day of my life!

After all that training, I'm pretty sure I still dread running, but I crave the feeling after a run (when I stop running). I also love what running represents: a constant process of self-improvement; to take one step after another even though your entire body is aching, and it's questioning why you need to run so much in the 21st century. 

Words cannot capture the sheer exhilaration during the last few miles on race day. The many months of grueling training was all for this moment. With complete strangers cheering me on, the adrenaline and the atmosphere drove me into a frenzy. I was running as fast as I could, my heart was going to explode, and my legs were begging me to stop, but I kept going! One leg after the other just like the training. I was tired, I was relieved, I was grateful, I was overjoyed, most importantly, I felt alive.
