"Be yourself", we are often told. What an awful advice. Aside from being unbearably cliché, It's not even useful. At the very least, you should <u>know</u> yourself first before you can <u>be</u> yourself. Seems like a simple enough two-part process, except the first part is non-trivial and might take an entire lifetime to figure out.

I've been "faking it until I'm making it" since high school. In many ways, I've been quite successful at completely altering my identity. There was a time when I hated running and dreaded reading. Now I take great pleasure in both. I remember getting unbelievably stressed when essays are due in English class. Now I find writing a pleasant pastime. Is my authentic self so elusive because my identity is always in flux? Am I wrong to believe that the self is malleable? Am I just confused? Which part of me should I keep? Which part of me should I subject to self-immolation? 

The central claim of existentialism is that "existence precedes essence". We are born undetermined. Our essence (nature) is NOT fundamental and immutable. Human beings create their own values and determine a meaning for their lives through their consciousness. Identities or values do NOT inherently exist. We must create them! In other words, we are not born with some pre-defined identity that's uniquely authentic to us, and we just need to find it somehow. There is nothing for us to find.

I've never really identified with any particular clique in school, nor any archetype portrayed in popular media. It didn't feel right to put on such fragile veneer. I sought other venues of self-expression in my youth. I am a tennis player; I am an engineer; I love kpop; I am a gamer; I like the TV show "Friends" and "The Office". None of these felt right. Jean-Paul Sartre coined a term for lazy and inauthentic ready-made identities: Bad Faith.

> Let us consider this waiter in the café. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at *being* a waiter in a café. There is nothing there to surprise us. - Jean-Paul Sartre in "Being and Nothingness"

The answer to the question of "who am I?" seemed eternally fleeting. Jean-Paul Sartre once made an amusing wordplay related to this topic: “I am what I am not; I am not what I am”. The idea Sartre is trying to convey is that we are made of both <u>facticity</u> (facts about ourselves; what we are) and <u>transcendence</u> (our potential; what we are not yet). Maybe from an existentialist point of view, we should “create ourselves”, a continuous process that only ends when we become pure facticities. In other words, maybe the only time we can truly "be ourselves" is when we are dead, and who wants to do that?
