## Introspection

- Why do I read? Is it to satisfy my curiosity and relish in the joy of learning? Or am I trying to parrot quotes from books and impress people with how smart and knowledgeable I am? 
- Why do I write blog posts? Is it a genuine attempt at improving my writing? Or am I a narcissist trying to show the world how different I am? How unique and profound I can be with all my thoughts and musings?
- Why do I exercise? Is it to better my health? Or is it purely for vanity so I can increase my dating prospect? 
- Why do I cook for my friends? Am I genuinely trying to serve them great food and bring them happiness? Or am I flexing on them with my cooking skills to satisfy my ego? 
- Why do I travel and take pictures? Is it to journal the exciting adventures of my life, so I can look back with nostalgia and delight when I'm older? Or is it to craft an fake image on social media so others won't think I live a boring life? 
- Am I really a kind person? Or am I selfishly trying to craft an image of someone who is a kind person?
- Why do I enjoy classical music? Why do I drink wine? Why do I drink coffee? Why do I do anything? 

## Individuation

There is a famous saying often attributed to John Pierpont Morgan that people have two reasons for doing anything; one that sounds good, and a real one. I'd love nothing more than to say I am a wholly authentic person, but I am probably not. I am a bundle of hypocrisy and contradiction just like everybody else (I hope). I've often wondered how others might answer questions like the ones above. It's definitely not the stuff you talk about at the watercooler with co-workers. 

When you stare into the abyss, it stares right back at you. It's agonizing to look into the recesses of your unconsciousness. Is it worth the identity crisis? All the ugliness, repressed feelings, primitive emotions, complexes, insecurities, emotional baggage. It'll shake the very foundation of who you think you are. I believe this is known as "confronting your shadows" in Jungian psychology, and it's apparently one of the first step towards an authentic self; a process Carl Jung calls "individuation". 

> “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate” - Carl Jung

Reading Carl Jung has been an incredibly enlightening - and challenging - endeavor. I find the idea of "personas" fascinating. In essence, personas are the social faces we present to the world - a kind of mask that we put on to make impressions upon others and to conceal our true selves. I do not speak with my co-workers in the same manner as I speak with my mother. I have masks for other occasions: like meeting with a manager, socializing at a party, ordering drinks at Starbucks, playing with a toddler, and etc. Can you imagine the absurdity of exuding "executive presence" when playing with a toddler? Or while you order your Irish cream cold brew at a coffee shop?

A danger that many people fall into is mistaking one's persona with one's identity. You are not "just" an engineer. You are not "just" a tennis player. If so, what happens if you get into an accident that prevents you from ever playing tennis again. That ensuing sense of emptiness and crisis in identity was there all along through a thin veneer. Either you prod into your own psyche, or the external world will eventually do it for you. The answer to the question of "who am I?" is not trivial. Shouldn't we be glad that we are not so easily definable? To quote Walt Whitman: 

> "I am large, I contain multitudes"

Knowing all this, is the road to authenticity the removal of all personas? Not quite. According to Jung, one cannot possibly be compatible with society without personas. Quotes: "The man with no persona [...] is blind to the reality of the world, which for him has merely the value of an amusing or fantastic playground.", "a state of disturbed psychic equilibrium". Essentially, these masks are necessary for us to perform a social role, otherwise we suffer.

Therein lies the conundrum. How can authenticity exist within the context of all these masks we put on ourselves? Aren't the two endeavors diametrically opposed to each other? According to my reading of Jung at least, the road to authenticity is NOT removal of personas, but developing stronger and more compatible personas that are helpful and expedient for your social needs, yet not collide nor hide your true self. How tiring... Seems like we've been putting on masks for each other long before COVID.

Unfortunately, I'm not there yet... On some days, I feel so vapid and performative; like a voice actor who’s forgotten his own voice. I go through life crafting one image after another. For school. For my career. For my family. For my friends circle A. For my friend circle B. For my co-workers. I put on one mask after another like a stage actor, or a court jester, carefully curating resumes of inauthenticity. Disingenuous pleasantries at the water cooler. An awkward half-smile at a company happy hour. Forced enthusiasm at a job interview. While I don't deny the benefit of being a socially adept, pleasant person, must we live in disguise all our lives?

> “We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves” - François de La Rochefoucauld

On rare days, I catch a glimpse of something authentic in me. Whether it’s during a great tennis rally, or at hotpot with close friends, or while in deep focus of some engaging work. My soul thirst for these rare and fleeting moments.
