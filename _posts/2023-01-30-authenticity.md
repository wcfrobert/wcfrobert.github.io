Why do I read? Is it to satisfy my curiosity and relish in the joy of learning? Or am I trying to parrot quotes from books and impress people with how smart and knowledgeable I am? 

---

Why do I write blog posts? Is it a genuine attempt at improving my writing? Or am I a narcissist trying to show the world how different I am? How unique and profound I can be with all my thoughts and musings?

---

Why do I exercise? Is it to better my health? Or is it purely for vanity so I can increase my dating prospect? 

---

Why do I cook for my friends? Am I genuinely trying to serve them great food and bring them happiness? Or am I flexing on them with my cooking skills to satisfy my ego? 

---

Why do I travel and take pictures? Is it to journal the exciting adventures of my life, so I can look back with nostalgia and delight when I'm older? Or is it to craft an fake image on social media so others won't think I live a boring life? 

---

Am I really a kind person? Or am I selfishly trying to craft an image of someone who is a kind person?

---

Why do I enjoy classical music? Why do I drink wine? Why do I drink coffee? Why do I do anything?

There is a famous saying often attributed to John Pierpont Morgan that people have two reasons for doing anything; one that sounds good, and a real one. I'd love nothing more than to say I am a wholly authentic person, but I am probably not. I am a bundle of hypocrisy and contradiction, hopefully just like everyone else. 

When you stare into the abyss, it stares right back at you. It's agonizing to look into the recesses of your unconsciousness. Is it worth the identity crisis? All the ugliness, repressed feelings, primitive emotions, complexes, insecurities, emotional baggage. It'll shake the very foundation of who you think you are. I believe this is known as "confronting your shadows" in Jungian psychology, and it's apparently one of the first step towards an authentic self; a process Carl Jung calls "individuation".

I've often wondered how others might answer questions like the ones above. It's definitely not the stuff you talk about at the watercooler with co-workers. 





## Shake and Bake; Fake and Make

"Be yourself", we are often told. What an awful advice. Aside from being unbearably cliché, It's not even useful. At the very least, you should <u>know</u> yourself first before you can <u>be</u> yourself. Seems like a simple enough two-part process, except the first part might take your entire lifetime to figure out.

I've been faking it until I'm making it since high school. In some ways, I've been too successful at completely altering my identity. There was a time when I hated running and dreaded reading. Now I take great pleasure in both. Funny how that worked out. To quote modern day philosopher DJ Khaled, I may be "suffering from success". (Apologies for the unexpected facetiousness. I wanted to add at least some humor to all this existential angst). 

The central claim of existentialism is: "existence precedes essence" right? Am I wrong to believe that the self is malleable? Which part of me should I keep? Which part of me should I subject to self-immolation? To quote an actual philosopher this time, Jean-Paul Sartre: “I am what I am not; I am not what I am”. The wordplay contains some apparent contradiction but what Sartre is trying to convey is that we are made of both facticity (facts about ourselves. What we are) and transcendence (Our potential. What we are not yet). We can’t have one without the other without falling into bad faith. So perhaps from an existentialist point of view, the correct path to authenticity is to: “create yourself”

Some days, I feel so vapid and performative; like a voice actor who's forgotten his own voice,. I go through life crafting one image after another. For school. For my career. For my date. For my family. For my friends circle A. For my friend circle B. For my co-workers. I put on one mask after another like a stage actor, or a court jester, carefully curating resumes of inauthenticity. Disingenuous pleasantries at the water cooler. An awkward half-smile at a company happy hour. Forced enthusiasm at a job interview. For what exactly? While I don't deny the benefit of being a socially adept, pleasant person, shouldn't we pursue something more authentic? Yet as Jung pointed out, the complete absence of persona means one would be incompatible with rest of society. As he puts it, they are "blind to the world, hopeless dreamers." How tiring... Seems like we've been wearing masks long before COVID-19.

On rare days, I catch a glimpse of something authentic in me. Whether it's during a great tennis rally, or at hotpot with close friends, or while in deep focus of some engaging work. My soul thirst for these rare and fleeting moments.

> Let us consider this waiter in the café. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at *being* a waiter in a café. There is nothing there to surprise us. - Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness
