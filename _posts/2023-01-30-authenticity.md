Why do I read? Is it to satisfy my curiosity and relish in the joy of learning? Or am I trying to parrot quotes from books and impress people with how smart and knowledgeable I am? 

---

Why do I write blog posts? Is it a genuine attempt at improving my writing? Or am I a narcissist trying to show the world how different I am? How unique and profound I can be with all my thoughts and musings?

---

Why do I exercise? Is it to better my health? Or is it purely for vanity so I can increase my dating prospect? 

---

Why do I cook for my friends? Am I genuinely trying to serve them great food and bring them happiness? Or am I flexing on them with my cooking skills to satisfy my ego? 

---

Why do I travel and take pictures? Is it to journal the exciting adventures of my life, so I can look back with nostalgia and delight when I'm older? Or is it to craft an fake image of my life on social media so others won't think I live a boring life? 

---

Am I really a kind person? Or am I selfishly trying to craft an image of someone who is a kind person?

---

Why do I enjoy classical music? Why do I drink wine? Why do I drink coffee? Why do I do anything?

## A Court Jester

There is a famous saying often attributed to John Pierpont Morgan that people have two reasons for doing anything; one that sounds good, and a real one. While my "score card" to questions like the ones above are undoubtedly better than it was 5 years ago, I am under no illusion of some self-perceived sanctity. Gosh! I would love nothing more than to say that I am a wholly authentic person, but the truth is, I am not. Even though I try real hard to be. I am a bundle of hypocrisy and contradiction, and I can only pray that everyone else is as well.

On some days, I feel so damn vapid and performative. I go through life crafting one image after another. For school. For my career. For my date. For my family. For my friends circle A. For my friend circle B. For my co-workers. I put on one mask after another like a stage actor, or a court jester, carefully curating resumes of inauthenticity. Disingenuous pleasantries at the water cooler. An awkward half-smile at a company happy hour. Forced enthusiasm at a job interview. For what exactly? When the show ends, and the curtain closes, are we met with cheers and applause? Or deafening silence? Yet it seems like we need personas. Carl Jung describes the absence of persona as a state of "disturbed psychic equilibrium". They are "blind to the world, hopeless dreamers". But where and how can I find authenticity? Isn't an authentic persona a contradiction in terms?

On rare days, I catch a glimpse of something authentic in me. Whether it's during a great tennis rally, or at hotpot with close friends, or while in deep focus of some engaging work. My soul thirst for these rare and fleeting moments.





> Let us consider this waiter in the café. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at *being* a waiter in a café. There is nothing there to surprise us. - Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness
