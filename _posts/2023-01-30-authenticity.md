Why do I read? Is it to satisfy my curiosity and relish in the joy of learning? Or am I trying to parrot quotes from books and impress people with how smart and knowledgeable I am? 

---

Why do I write blog posts? Is it a genuine attempt at improving my writing? Or am I a narcissist trying to show the world how different I am? How unique and profound I can be with all my thoughts and musings?

---

Why do I exercise? Is it to better my health? Or is it purely for vanity so I can increase my dating prospect? 

---

Why do I cook for my friends? Am I genuinely trying to serve them great food and bring them happiness? Or am I flexing on them with my cooking skills to satisfy my ego? 

---

Why do I travel and take pictures? Is it to journal the exciting adventures of my life, so I can look back with nostalgia and delight when I'm older? Or is it to craft an fake image on social media so others won't think I live a boring life? 

---

Am I really a kind person? Or am I selfishly trying to craft an image of someone who is a kind person?

---

Why do I enjoy classical music? Why do I drink wine? Why do I drink coffee? Why do I do anything?

There is a famous saying often attributed to John Pierpont Morgan that people have two reasons for doing anything; one that sounds good, and a real one. I'd love nothing more than to think of myself only in positive terms, but I am not delusional. Gosh! I wish I am a wholly authentic person, but I am probably not. I am a bundle of hypocrisy and contradiction, hopefully just like everyone else. 

When you stare into the abyss, it stares right back at you. It takes courage to look into your unconsciousness. You probably won't like what you find there. All the ugliness, repressed feelings, primitive emotions, complexes, insecurities, emotional baggage. I believe it's called "confronting your shadows" in Jungian psychology, and it's one of the first step towards an authentic self; a process Jung calls "individuation". Who am I? Am I just a masochist prone to neurotic rumination? A rambling pretentious fool? My god! Nothing like having a quarter-life identity crisis for breakfast. 



## Shake and Bake; Fake and Make

> "We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves" - François de La Rochefoucauld

"Be yourself", we are often told. What an awful advice. Aside from being unbearably cliché, It's not even useful. I think the full version should be to "Know yourself, then be yourself". Simple enough, except the first part might take your entire lifetime to figure out.

I've been faking it until I'm making it since high school. Maybe I've been too successful. To quote modern day philosopher DJ Khaled, I may be "suffering from success". (Apologies for being facetious. I wanted to add at least some humor to all this existential angst). To quote an actual philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, the central claim of existentialism is: "existence precedes essence" right? Am I wrong to believe that the self is malleable? Which part of me should I keep? Which part of me should I subject to self-immolation? 

It's easy enough to pick things I value. But what's giving me trouble is answering a second-order question: why do I value what I value? Sounds like pointless philosophizing, but I don't think it is. 

On some days, I feel so damn vapid and performative; like a voice actor who's forgotten his own voice, or an actor who's decided to permanently behave like a movie character in real life. I go through life crafting one image after another. For school. For my career. For my date. For my family. For my friends circle A. For my friend circle B. For my co-workers. I put on one mask after another like a stage actor, or a court jester, carefully curating resumes of inauthenticity. Disingenuous pleasantries at the water cooler. An awkward half-smile at a company happy hour. Forced enthusiasm at a job interview. For what exactly? 

On rare days, I catch a glimpse of something authentic in me. Whether it's during a great tennis rally, or at hotpot with close friends, or while in deep focus of some engaging work. My soul thirst for these rare and fleeting moments.

> Let us consider this waiter in the café. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at *being* a waiter in a café. There is nothing there to surprise us. - Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness
