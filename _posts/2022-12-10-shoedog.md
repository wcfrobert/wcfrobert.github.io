As soon as I started reading Shoe Dog, I knew it was going to be one of *those* books. The ones you just can't put down. The ones that negatively impact your sleep schedule because: "just one more page!"

Shoe Dog has been recommended to me probably a dozen times in the past few years. Now I can see why. I didn't think autobiographies could be this entertaining and engagingly. It was crisply written with an impeccable sense of humor and humility. Shoe Dog was a page-turner from start to finish.

Shoe Dog is the life story, and business adventures of Phil Knight, founder of arguably the most recognizable sports brand in the world. We follow Phil on his journey from an ambitious MBA student trying to find his place in the world to founding and growing Nikes to a $170 billion global behemoth. Shoe Dog gives us an insider look at what business success looks like.

## Finding His Path

> "On paper, I thought, I'm an adult [...] My resume said I was a learned, accomplished soldier, a twenty-four-year-old man in full... So why, I wondered, why do I still feel like a kid?"

Phil Knight grew up in Portland Oregon. He graduated from University of Oregon, served one year in the army, and then went to Stanford Business School. He was successful by all measures, but he nevertheless felt lost. He knew he wanted something more. He wanted a purpose. More than anything, he wanted to win.

In 1962, he did what any twenty-year old would have done if given the resources. He did some soul-searching and traveled the world (there was a time in the past when that was financially possible for a twenty year old). He worked odd jobs in Hawaii, met new friends in Greece. Traveled to India, Egypt, Israel, Greece.

His adventure led him to Japan. 

* Back in the 1960s, Japan was known for its discipline, impeccable order, and extreme cleanliness. More than anything, Japan's economic miracle after the war showed the world what its industries are capable of.
* During the second World War, American B-29s dropped 750,000 pounds of gasoline and flammable jelly in what was euphemistically named "strategic bombings". Tokyo, and many other cities back then were made largely of wood. Three hundred thousand people were burned alive during these bombing runs (4x more than Hiroshima), more than a million people injured, 80% of all buildings vaporized, cities were wiped off the map. 
* From the ruins of the second world war, Japan recovered to become the third largest economy in the world. 
* During his time at Stanford Business School, Phil wrote a research paper in his entrepreneurial seminar class on the opportunity in outsourcing shoe manufacturing to Japan. In brief, in the 1960s, Japan had its economic miracle and its cameras had made a deep cut into the camera market that was previously dominated by Germans. Seeing the opportunities created by globalization, Phil argued that the same thing could happen to running shoes.
* Before the trip, Phil had prepared extensively for the different business practices in Japan. He wanted to pitch his "crazy idea" to a growing Japanese shoe company known as Onitsuka (now known as Asics)

> "The key is don't be pushy. Don't come on like the typical asshole American, the typical gaijin - rude, loud, aggressive, not taking no for an answer. The Japanese do not react well to the hard sell. Negotiations here tend to be soft, sinewy. [...] It's a culture of indirection. No one ever turns you down flat. No one ever says straight out, no. But they don't say yes, either. They speak in circles, sentences with no clear subject or object"

What happened in Japan is just amazing! A sign of extreme hutzpah (or arrogance I don't know...). Phil, as a jobless twenty-something year old with no income, managed to bluff his way into signing a US distribution deal with Onitsuka.

> "Mr. Miyazaki interrupted. 'Mr. Knight, what company are you with?'"
>
> "Ah, yes, good question"
>
>  Adrenaline surging through my blood, I felt the flight response, the longing to run and hide, which made me think of the safest place in the world. My parents' house. [...] I'd also covered one wall with my blue ribbons from track, the one thing in my life of which I was unabashedly proud.
>
> "Blue Ribbon," I blurted . "Gentlemen, I represent Blue Ribbon Sports of Portland, Oregon."

## Blue Ribbon

Of course, Blue Ribbon Sports didn't exist. At least not yet.

After signing a distribution deal with Onitsuka, Phil worked part-time shipping shoes off from his garage while keeping his PwC accounting job. 

For about three years, Phil worked tirelessly and grew his distribution business to a decent size. His success in selling shoes was initially puzzling to him given his introverted nature and poor salesmanship skills. He realized he was able to sell shoes because he believed in running. Being a runner himself, Phil was also able to recruit some amazing partners, including legendary American running coach Bill Bowerman. 

Back in those days, venture capital was not a thing. Any aspiring entrepreneur only had a few places to turn to, namely banks, and they are all guarded by risk-averse gate-keepers with zero imagination. The biggest problem Phil faced during his early days was the lack of "equity".

> "Equity. How I was beginning to loathe this world [...] It was bureaucratic jargon, a euphemism for cold hard cash, of which I had none. [...]"

> "To have cash balance sitting around doing nothing made no sense to me. [...] I wanted to keep my foot pressed hard on the gas pedal"

In 1966, Phil went back to Japan. Again, he worked his magic and bluffed his way into making Blue Ribbon the sole distributor (pun intended) of Onitsuka Tiger running shoes in the US.

> "I tried to be nonchalant as I signed the papers and placed an order for 5,000 more shoes, which would cost $20,000 I didn't have. Kitami said he'd ship them to my East Coast Office, which I also didn't have"



## Nikes And Birth of The Swoosh

Eventually, Blue Ribbons grew too big and the law of Thucydides trap prevailed. With some looming legal troubles from Onitsuka, it was clear that Blue Ribbon cannot rely on being a shoe distributor anymore. 

By this time, Phil had quit his job at PwC to focus on Blue Ribbons. He also started teaching accounting courses at Oregon State University. At OSU, he met his eventual wife Penelope, as well as graphics design student Carolyn Davidson.

After relocating some production to Canada and Mexico, the next order of business was to come up a name and a logo. For a brand that is as ubiquitous as Nikes and its swoosh, the background story is amusing to say the least!

* Nike was actually not the original name, there were many other suggestions. Falcon, Dimension Six, Maverick, Bengal. Phil preferred Dimension Six but everyone else thought that was impossibly bad.
* At the last minute, Jeff Johnson, one of the first employees, said a name came to him in a dream

> "He says he sat bolt upright in bed in the middle of the night and saw the name before him," Woodell said.
>
> "What is it?" I asked, bracing myself.
>
> "Nikes"
>
> "Huh?"
>
> "Nikes"
>
> "Spell it."

* Nikes - the Greek goddess of victory. We can be glad they didn't pick Dimension Six.

The story behind The Swoosh, now worth $33 billion dollars, is equally amusing. Phil recalled meeting a graphics design student at OSU. Carolyn Davidson. He called her and asked her to come up with some prototypes.

She came back with a portfolio of rough sketches. Phil was not a fan. What is it? A fat lightning bolt? Chubby check marks?

> "Her design did evoke motion, of a kind, but also motion sickness. None spoke to me"

She refined her design and eventually it stuck. For her many hours of work, Phil and his team gave Carolyn their deepest tanks and a check for $35. (Phil eventually gave her $1,000,000 in shares when Nike went public)

In 1971, Blue Ribbon was renamed to Nikes. Its debut waffle iron trainer was a massive success. This was just the beginning.



The story behind the waffle iron trainer is bizarre and unbelievable in of itself. The first pairs were literally made in a waffle iron... Bill Bowerman, while watching his wife make waffles for breakfast, had the brilliant idea of shaping the sole in the same pattern as a waffle for better grip. Long story short, his wife had to get new waffle iron for breakfast next morning.
