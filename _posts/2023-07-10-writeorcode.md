Well... I haven't written anything serious nor well-thought-out in about five months (or ever depending on who you ask). I believe this is the longest hiatus ever since this blog's inception. The sloth and lack of discipline is self-evident and I won't bore you with all the excuses. It's also delightfully ironic how my last two serious post were both about all the benefits of writing, and how it is a Nietzschean will-to-power.

Anyways, I stopped writing for a few months to focus my effort on coding and my programming side-projects. I think I've improved a lot but it's taken away so much of my time and energy. 

For the second half of this year, I would like to redirect my effort towards reading and writing. I must say I much preferred writing prose over writing code. I find that I am more sociable and have more interesting factoids to parrot. Like how as many as 400 million beavers roamed the continent back in the 1600s, and they were key to the economic development of Canada; becoming an early official emblem. Apparently, the beaver trade was highly profitable. Their pelt is excellent for hat making due to their water repelling properties. Their yellow-brownish anal secretion (Castoreum) was used both in perfume and as a vanilla substitute. The thought of Victorian ladies spraying essence of beaver excretion on themselves is quite amusing. I'd be curious to try it out too. Where is my Chanel No.5 Eau de Beaver?

I'm not sure where I was going with that... The point is: I don't get the same reception when I talk about the benefits of memoization, array-broadcasting, vectorization, and some other stuff I've been learning about. In short, I hope to read more about beavers, and less about data-structures in the latter half of 2023.
