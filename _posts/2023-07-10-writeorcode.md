Well... I haven't written anything serious nor well-thought-out in about five months (or ever depending on who you ask). I believe this is my longest hiatus ever since this blog's inception. The sloth and lack of discipline is self-evident and I won't bore you with all the excuses. It's also delightfully comical how my last two serious articles both touted the benefits of writing, and how it is a Nietzschean will-to-power.

Anyways, I stopped writing for a few months to focus my effort on coding and some python side-projects. I think I've improved a lot but it's taken away so much of my time and energy. 

For the second half of this year, I would like to redirect my effort towards reading and writing. I must say I much preferred writing prose over writing code. I find that I am more sociable and have more interesting factoids to parrot. Like how as many as 400 million beavers roamed the Canada back in the 1600s, and how they were key to Canada's economic development; becoming an early official emblem. The beaver trade was highly profitable. Their pelt is excellent for hat making due to their water-resistant properties. Their yellow-brownish anal secretion (Castoreum) was used both in perfume and as a vanilla substitute. Where is my Chanel No.5 Eau de Beaver?

The point is: I don't get the same reception when I talk about the benefits of memoization, array-broadcasting, vectorization, etc. For the latter half of 2023, I hope to read more about beavers, and less about data-structures.
