Well... I haven't written anything serious or well-thought-out in about five months (or ever depending on who you ask). I believe this to be the longest hiatus ever since this blog's inception. The sloth and lack of discipline is self-evident and I won't bore you with all the excuses. Isn't it delightfully ironic that my last two serious post were both about all the benefits of writing, and how writing is a Nietzschean will-to-power and will make you more "formidable".

Anyways, I stopped writing for a few months to focus my effort on coding and building my side-projects. I think I've improved quite dramatically but it's taken away so much of my time and energy. 

For the second half of this year, I would like to redirect my effort towards reading and writing. I must say I much preferred writing prose over writing code. I find that I am more sociable and have more interesting factoids to parrot at the dinner table. Like how beavers, as many as 400 million back in the 1600s, roamed the continent and was key to the founding of Canada. In fact, it is one of Canada's official emblems. Apparently the beaver trade was highly profitable. Their pelt is excellent for hat making due to their water repelling properties. Their yellow-brownish anal secretion (Castoreum) was used both in perfume and as a vanilla substitute. Imagining Victorian ladies spraying essence of beaver excretion on themselves is quite amusing. I'd be curious to try it out too. Where is my Chanel No.5 Eau de Beaver?

I'm not sure where I am going with that, maybe I am writing this whole article to fit that one in. The point is this: for some reason I don't get the same reception when I talk about the benefits of memoization, array-broadcasting, vectorization, etc.

In summary, I hope to read more about beavers, and less about data-structures in the latter half of 2023.
