Like the rest of the world, I’ve been reading articles after articles of the 7.8 and 7.5 magnitude earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria earlier this week. Needless to say, I’m pretty mentally disturbed right now. Thousands of photos and videos flooded the internet Monday morning, making this whole tragedy that much more poignant and stomach-churning. 

What senseless suffering... Entire families entombed within the rubble they once called home. Many perished in an instant; crushed to death by slabs of concrete. In some twisted way, maybe these were the merciful deaths. The unthinkable alternative is to be trapped deep within the ruins, often with broken limbs, crying out for help as the merciless freezing temperature of the night descends upon the city. How terrifying it must be to know that your plea for help may not be answered in time due to the lack of resources during time of crisis. God bless all the poor souls affected by this tragedy...

* I saw a photo on Twitter that has since gone viral. It's a photo of a father, sitting in the ruins of what was once an apartment building, holding a hand that's reaching out through some tiny crevice. He is bundled up in a near fetal position with that "thousand-yard stare". The ashened hand apparently belongs to his now dead fifteen year old daughter.

* Another video shows a young girl with her sibling; half of their bodies lodged in by concrete and webs of rebar. With hair and face coated in dust, they look longingly at the rescuers, with eyes that's seen too much for such young souls, “Get me out of here mister, I’ll do anything for you,” the older child whispers to rescuers. “I’ll be your servant,” she adds, as a rescuer replies, “No, no.”

* An article by the Associated Press reported the miraculous survival of a newborn girl, rescued with her umbilical cords still attached to her now dead mother. Apparently the mother gave birth while trapped underneath a collapsed building. If there is an afterlife, I pray that the mother may rest peacefully knowing her baby is alive and well, that the rescuer found her in time.

One death is a tragedy. A thousand death becomes a statistic. While these stories are gut-wrenching, they serve as a helpful reminder that the casualty figures we see on headlines are not <u>just</u> numbers; they're the conglomeration of these heartbreaking stories multiplied 20,000+ times.

There is an unwelcomed numbing effect that eventually takes over. Perhaps it's useless, even masochistic, to dwell on the misery for too long. There's plenty of positive news as well. Like the numerous call for action and donation campaigns sprouting up on social media. Seeing entire circles of friends united towards one cause is truly heartwarming. On the ground, volunteers and rescuers have saved over 9,000 people who were once trapped beneath collapsed buildings. Quite simply, these people are heroes. With frost-bitten hands and heavy bloodshot eyes, extreme levels of exhaustion and sleep deprivation, they brace the unreasonable coldness of the night, lifting, digging, and heaving. They enter collapsed buildings with no regard for possible aftershocks that might entomb them too, all in the hope of saving just one more person. These stories are enough to soothe the heart, however fleeting that sense of comfort may last.

It’s moments like these that you realize the absurdity of our tribal political discourse. We just have to care about what AOC or Trump said on social media? Left-wing, right-wing, blue, red, all of our trivial trial and tribulations, the war in Ukraine, geopolitical maneuvers, man-caused sufferings, conflict between countries, religion, race, gender, ideologies. How monstrously ridiculous... How astoundingly stupid...

I'm reminded of a political cartoon I saw many years ago. I can't find it anymore for the life of me. Essentially, two aliens are conversing about the discovery of nuclear power on Planet Earth. I'm paraphrasing here:

> "We found intelligent life on Earth. They are now capable of building nuclear bombs! Should we be worried?" Said one alien to another.
>
> "There is no need to worry. They only seem interested in pointing the bombs at themselves" the other alien replied.

It’s also moments like these that I get a renewed sense of purpose in my chosen career. I've worked on multiple seismic retrofits here in the Bay Area. It's inspiring to know that the numbers on my spreadsheet, complicated equations scribbled in my notepad, line works on a blueprint, all translate to tangible value in the real world. The work isn't always easy or fun, and the remuneration can't match that of a Bay Area software developer, but golly is it fulfilling to think your work may one day prevent even one tragedy like the ones above from happening, that your efforts will contribute to a more resilient city, that lives will be saved because of you and the community of engineers, regulators, financiers who contribute to these efforts.

It would be hubris for me to say I have anything valuable to add to this crisis. I'm writing this article partly for my own selfish reasons as a way to collect my thoughts. But often after a major earthquake, a few family or friend inevitably reach out as if I am some subject matter expert. I am not... There are engineers in my firm who's had more years of work experience than I've been alive! Sometimes by a factor of 2. But I'll try my best to give some perspective as a junior engineer specializing in earthquakes engineering.



## Will An Earthquake Like That Happen Here?

Yes. 

We know a big one will hit us eventually. **It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when**. It's been sealed into our foreseeable future. USGS estimates that within the next 30 years in the Bay Area, the probability is ([source](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-probability-earthquake-will-occur-los-angeles-area-san-francisco-bay-area#:~:text=Within%20the%20next%2030%20years,an%20earthquake%20measuring%20magnitude%207.5)):

- 72% that an earthquake measuring magnitude 6.7 will occur
- 51% that an earthquake measuring magnitude 7 will occur
- 20% that an earthquake measuring magnitude 7.5 will occur

Unlike countries like Japan, which gets hit by a major earthquakes every decade or so, we tend to have some sort of collective amnesia when it comes to earthquakes. 

- The last major earthquake that happened in California was almost 30 years ago. The 1994 Northridge earthquake was 6.7 in magnitude and caused 57 deaths, over 9000 injuries, and $24 to $93 billion dollars in damage adjusted for inflation. This Turkey-Syria earthquake (7.8 magnitude) is 12x bigger.
- The last fault-rupture that occurred right on our door steps was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The shaking and the ensuing fire essentially leveled the city.
- Immediately after the Northridge earthquake of 1994, roughly 2/3 of Cupertino homeowners had earthquake insurance. In 2022, that number is around 10%.
- In Japan, landlords can charge their tenants higher rent for properties that are seismically-isolated. Here, developers are hesitant to spend any extra money beyond code-minimum because they see no upside other than it being a notable dent in their profit margin. Will an earthquake even happen in the building's 50 year design life? Existing building owners are reluctant to spend millions of dollars retrofitting their building in ways that the tenants won't even notice. Who can blame them. We are not equipped at dealing with low-probability high-consequence events like earthquakes. 



## Are We More Prepared In The US?

Yes, but not enough. 

On average, our building code, engineering, regulating agencies, permitting process, planning, and construction quality are all better. But there are two very important caveats:

* Not all buildings are new. Our cities are still mostly defined by inventories of older structures built shortly after the second world war, when building codes weren't as developed.
* The goal of the building code is to minimize casualties, not to make buildings earthquake-proof. Buildings that are seismically code-compliant are designed for **collapse prevention** (i.e. saving lives). You should still expect damage, down time, and tremendous economic losses.

The concrete buildings you see in Turkey and Syria are here at home too! Although they may be better designed and constructed, they're still vulnerable. In 2014, Professor Jack Moehle at Berkeley, arguably the most prominent expert in seismic behavior of concrete structure, combed through inventories of building in LA and identified concrete buildings at a risk of collapse. He initially labeled them "death buildings", but there were some legal complications to doing that. Eventually, he sorted everything out with the city and released the address of about 1,500 old concrete buildings. You can read more about it in the link here: [In reversal, quake researchers to turn over list of concrete buildings](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-01-18-concrete-building-quake-20140118-story.html). We have quite a few here in the Bay Area as well.

We always learn something new after an earthquake. The 1994 Northridge earthquake uncovered a dangerous detailing flaw that causes connections in steel buildings to facture prematurely. This deficiency affected many tall buildings in San Francisco. Who knows what the next earthquake will uncover. You can read more about it here: [San Francisco’s Big Seismic Gamble](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/17/us/san-francisco-earthquake-seismic-gamble.html).

Although architects seem to have an insatiable appetite for creativity and weird geometry, structural engineers have always been able to accommodate. We've made many innovative strides in the field of earthquake engineering, but there's inevitably going to be some concerns. Here's a thought-provoking quote from the NYT article above.

> This raises concerns among experts such as Thomas H. Heaton, the director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology and perhaps the most prominent skeptic of building high rises in earthquake zones.
>
> “It’s kind of like getting in a new airplane that’s only been designed on paper but nobody has ever flown in it” he said.

Lastly, a problem that's near and dear to my heart. Even though interest in earthquake engineering has waned significantly in recent decades, the science is far from settled! In fact, I think the public will be astonished by the degree of our ignorance, at how little we know, at the types of assumptions we make. Part of the problem is funding. Macro-level mechanics research in building structures just can't get much funding nowadays unless you make some tenuous connection to sexier topics like risk analysis, machine learning, sensors and signal processing, etc. 

Another challenge that may or may not be surmountable is the insane level of uncertainty in earthquake engineering. That one engineering quote comes to mind; about how we model materials we don't fully understand, into shapes we can't analyze, to withstand forces we can't predict. Even the most basic ingredient, like the acceleration experienced by a building during an earthquake, is dependent on a dizzying array of factors, most of which we can't determine for certain. At the material level, even if we can predict behaviors with 95% accuracy (highly unlikely at the building scale with unreliable materials like concrete), the results will inevitably start to diverge over the tens of thousands of time step of a ground motion. Imagine an airplane leaving from Los Angeles flying direct to Rome. If the nose of the airplane is pointed just 1 degree off course to the south, after 12 hours the plane will land somewhere in Tunisia, Africa. If there is a one degree difference to the north the plane might land in Slovenia or Austria. It's pretty much an inside joke how bad we are at predicting residual drift (i.e. how out-of-plumb the building will be after an earthquake).

The current approach is to conduct sensitivity studies, Monte-Carlo simulations, and using mind-bendingly sophisticated uncertainty quantification methods to glean insight from all the chaos. The level of math is way beyond my ability. It all seems reasonable enough, but I feel like some phenomenon should be made deterministic through more fundamental research (we should at least try). You can't just keep slapping on uncertainty quantification until insights emerge. Maybe you can, I wouldn't know...

## Why Aren't Modern Buildings Designed To Be Earthquake Proof?

It's too expensive.

If you live in California, and you recently bought a house, look in your stack of paperwork. You'll likely find clauses similar to the ones below:

<img src="/assets/img/blog/turkeysyria1.png" style="width:65%;"/>
*Excerpt I Got From a Friend Who Bought A House Recently*

There's a nice analogy to car crashes I read somewhere online. If we designed every car on the road to survive car crashes without a scratch, first of all there would be less drivers, secondly all the remaining drivers will be driving tanks.

* If you get into a car accident, your car might be totaled, but at least your life will be protected.
* If an earthquake happens, the building might be damaged beyond repair, but at least the occupants will be safe. 

The 2011 Christchurch earthquake may serve as a good example of what to expect. If an earthquake were to strike the Bay area, I believe the casualty numbers will be kept quite low. But down-time, and the ensuing economic losses will be astronomical, like nothing we've ever seen before. Would it spell the end of Silicon Valley? I feel like it's possible. [Before and after: how the 2011 earthquake changed Christchurch](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/22/before-and-after-how-the-2011-earthquake-changed-christchurch)

It is also worth noting that there <u>are</u> "tank" buildings. The safest place you can be during an earthquake is inside a hospital, elementary school, police station, fire station, or buildings for essential services. These structures are designed to higher standards and are required to remain occupational even after an earthquake. 

* Single family homes also have a very low probability of collapse. Dry walls might crack, bookshelves might fall, but these structures are just too light for the seismic acceleration to do any significant structural damage.
* Surprisingly, super-tall skyscrapers are also quite safe from earthquakes. The high frequency content of most earthquakes doesn't match the skyscaper's low frequency of vibration. I think my electrical engineering friend called it a "low-pass filter"? Many super-tall buildings designs are actually governed wind and occupancy comfort considerations over earthquakes. You might get very sea-sick on the top floor though. In someways, you might actually be safer inside the building as it protects you from falling debris and cladding. [Check out this video which shows how building's period of vibration can drastically affect its behavior](https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/video/building_resonance__boss_model_construction__use). One notable exception is the Mexico City earthquake of 1985. Some have described the ground motion of that event as closer to that of ocean waves.

On the other hand, the most vulnerable buildings are:

* Soft-story buildings - the first floor will very predictably collapse. Luckily, they're fairly easy to retrofit. Ask your landlord if you live in one of these.
  * <img src="/assets/img/blog/turkeysyria2.png" style="width:45%;"/>
* Unreinforced masonry - I don't even think its legal to build these in high seismic regions. They are death-traps. Reinforced masonry has steel rebar embeded into them. They are somewhat better but still not ideal.
  * <img src="/assets/img/blog/turkeysyria3.png" style="width:45%;"/>
* Older non-ductile shear wall buildings - Common for old tall apartment buildings like the ones we saw in Turkey. Harder to spot as a non-engineer. The snip below shows the massive difference in detailing rigor between the two
  * <img src="/assets/img/blog/turkeysyria4.png" style="width:45%;"/>
* Tilt-up construction - Walls are cast on the ground then lifted into place. Structure is tied together by a timber roof. Common for one-story warehouse or office buildings. We've dramatically improved the performance of these buildings over the years, but the older one's are not adequately tied and the walls fall which leads to complete collapse.
  * <img src="/assets/img/blog/turkeysyria5.png" style="width:45%;"/>
* Buildings with weird geometries and architectural flair - Might be okay <u>theoretically</u>. But like the quote above. It’s kind of like getting in a new airplane that’s only been designed on paper but nobody has ever flown in it
