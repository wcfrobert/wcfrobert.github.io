I recently went on a road trip across the West Coast. I've never traveled with my own hard-earned money before. My gosh! it was expensive... I won't give you specific numbers, but let's just say it has exhausted my savings and I am one missed paycheck from financial ruin. 

After the trip, I started thinking about all those travel credit card ads I get in the mail. Perhaps there is a thriftier way to travel.

Through some searching, I stumbled across a fascinating community of folks obsessed with personal finance and credit card rewards. Like any other hobby, the rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than one could imagine.

First out of interest, then out of the desire to improve the burning wreckage that is my personal finances, I read countless articles and watched hundreds of videos on the subject of credit cards. I'm by no means an expert, but I did manage to get a cursory overview of how it works and why some people are so into it.

## Why Use Credit Cards? 

First of all, all of this only applies if you are the type of person to always pay your balance in full and never let interest accrue. Otherwise, stay away as far away from credit cards as you can. 

We spend our money in one of three ways:

* Direct Debit/Checks
  * Mostly used for rent/mortgage, car lease/loan. You should never use debit for daily purchases for security reasons. If you ever lose your card and your bank account gets drained, good luck getting that money back. While it is not impossible, it is certainly an uphill battle that will put your life on hold... On the other hand, it is much easier to claim lost or stolen credit card. Disputes can be resolved with a single phone call.

* Cash
  * As for cash, if you are still using cash for your daily purchases in the year 2022, then I am glad your money-laundering or drug-dealing business is doing well. Silliness aside, carrying cash everywhere is just inconvenient

* Credit card

Credit card should really be the payment option of choice because: 

* It is convenient and secure
* Builds your credit score
* Perks and rewards



## Credit Card Rewards

Think of your cash outflow like a giant river flowing downstream. That is to say, money is coming out of your pocket either way.

If you are a fisherman, regardless how many fish you catch, a certain number of salmon swims through the river each day. Credit cards are the fishing nets in this analogy. Better rewards = bigger net and thus more fish caught. Might as well try to get as much benefit from it as possible. 

To give a concrete example, I spend about $20,000 a year on food, grocery, shopping, and etc. Using my Chase Amazon Prime card, I get about $500 to $800 back each year. That is roughly 2%-3% effective cashback.

Consider three scenarios:

1. You spend $20,000 in cash only -> $0
2. You spend $20,000 using a basic 2% cashback card -> $400
3. You optimize credit card usage and get 5% back on everything -> $1,000

It's not really a life-changing amount of money, but it's a nice sum for some end-of-the-year shopping.

You can usually get the 1.5x to 5x more value from travel credit cards. Of course, getting the highest cent per point requires research and planning. It is a time-consuming hobby for some people. Others might find their time better spent elsewhere. 

There are levels to this obsession. Some just have a work-horse cash back credit card, while others apply dozens of credit card each year for their sign-up bonuses (known as churning).

I'm not sure if credit card churning is worth it. Like many things in life, you reach a point of diminishing return. Of course, it's all good information, but credit card maximization won't really move the needle in terms of your overall financial goals.

That being said, I think being aware of where you can be more thrifty when traveling is valuable.

Ultimately, I'm not really improving my financial positions with my credit card set up, but damn it feels good to book a $800 per night hotels in New York for 25,000 points!
