After reading Sophie's World, I thought it would be an amusing exercise to read and summarize the key insights from each philosophers presented therein. This is objectively a foolish undertaking. There are academics who have spent their entire lives studying one or two philosophers. Yet here I am embarking on the task of summarizing all of Western philosophy. However, my goal is not comprehensive understanding of everything. My goal is simply to be conversant, to "know enough to be dangerous" as the saying goes. With all of that out of the way, this article will present three key insights of philosopher from the time of Socrates to Sartre. Let's get started!

# Myths - Pre 600 BC

In the beginning of human civilization, we made sense of the world through **myths**: stories about the gods for why the world is the way it is. For instance, people observed that crops would grow after rain. Without science, myths were created to explain this natural phenomenon. In Norse mythology, Thor is worshipped as the god of fertility because Thunder (Thordon in Norwegian) and the accompanying rain often brought bountiful harvest. 

History is replete interesting myths from the Pharaohs of Egypt, to the Azure dragons of China, to the thunder god who ruled Mount Olympus. **Stories** seems fundamental to how we understand the world, even to the present day.



# Natural Philosophers - 600 BC

From 600 BC onwards, some of the first Philosophers in the world (from Greece) sought to explain the world through **natural** processes, rather than **supernatural** ones. They were also known as **pre-Socratic** philosophers.

<u>Thales of Miletus</u> 

- **Reason Over Myths**: Thales is one of the first to use reason rather than myths to explain the world. He calculated the height of the Pyramid by measuring its shadow. He accurately predicted solar eclipses. He also thought all things were made of water.

<u>Anaximander of Miletus</u> 

- All things are made of a material beyond human comprehension called "boundless"

<u>Anaximenes of Miletus</u>  

- All things are made of air.

<u>Empedocles</u> 

- Nature cannot be made of a single element, instead it must be four: earth, fire, air, and water. These four elements are combined through "love" and separated through "strife", both of which are natural forces.

<u>Parmenides of Elea</u> 

- **Being is Unchanging** - something cannot be created from nothing. Everything that exist has always existed. 
- Change itself is an illusion. Human reason, rather than perception must be the primary source of knowledge of the world because things we perceive with our senses can be deceiving. 

<u>Heraclitus</u> 

- **Everything Flows** - everything is in a state of flux. Like a stream, when we step into it the second time, neither us nor the stream are the same as it was the first time. In contrast to Parmenides, Heraclitus proposed that change is fundamental to reality. 

> "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man"

- **The Unity of Opposites**: the world is characterized by opposites. Like two sides of a coin: good and evil, light and darkness, winter and spring, war and peace. Without out this intricate balance, the world would cease to exist.

<u>Anaxagoras</u> 

- All things are made of infinite number of minute particles invisible to the eye. His astute **astronomical observations** were ahead of his time. He correctly predicted that all stars were made of same substance as Earth, that there might be human life on other planets, and that the moon does not have its own light, but rather shines because of reflection of sunlight from Earth's surface. 

<u>Democritus</u> 

- All things are made of tiny invisible building blocks he called **"atoms"** - meaning "un-cuttable". Nature cannot be infinitely divided. The smallest piece possible is the atom. Modern science is very much in line with Democritus's theory. 
- He held the **materialist** that human body and souls were no different. Everything is made of atoms. Souls were made of "soul atoms".

<u>Fathers of History and Medicine</u>

Contemporary to the natural philosophers were the first doctors and historians (also from Greece).

* **Herodotus** - known as the father of history. He wrote detailed accounts of the Greco-Persian War often with artistic flourish. Although entertaining, he is sometimes criticized for including fanciful stories. That is why some call him the father of lies, or the ancient screenwriter.
* **Thucydides** - Contrary to Herodotus, Thucydides was known as the father of "scientific history". He applied strict standards of impartiality and evidence gathering. He wrote about the Peloponnesian War. The term "Thucydides trap" refers to the inclination towards war between an uprising power and a declining existing power
* **Hippocrates** - known as the father of medicine.
  * The word "Influenza" means a malign influence from the stars. Before Hippocrates, sickness was thought to be due to supernatural causes
  * He believed that the best safeguard against sickness is **balance**. Moderation and a healthy lifestyle is key. When sickness occurs, it is due to physical or mental inbalance.
  * He is also known for the **Hippocratic Oath**; medical ethics that doctors still recite to this day. 





# Sophists - 500 BC

The Socratic philosophers all lived in Athens, which was the center of culture and history in the Greek world. Let's first talk about a class of Socratic philosophers known as the Sophists.

* Sophist were teachers or **intellectuals for hire** in ancient Greece. They make a living out of teaching and giving lectures to citizens. Topics are wide ranging from philosophy, music, athletics and mathematics. Most of their writings were lost to history and we often only have second-hand accounts.
  * Lycophron was a **Skeptic** who believed that man do not posses the means to know the truth of the world, nor the existence of god. He was critical of mythologies but also of fruitless philosophical speculations.
  * Xeniades believed that certain human traits are **socially induced** rather than natural. He opposed the notion of **aristocratic birth**. He also believed that laws were simply a matter of agreement, a social convention that changes over time, not some universal law.
  * Protagoras was credited by Plato as inventing the role of professional sophist. He is known for the quote: "Man is the measure of all things", which sowed the seed to Humanism during the Renaissance. He also believed that there is no objective truth, only relative truth (**relativism**). Person A may think the weather is cold, while person B may think it is hot. There cannot be an absolute evaluation because it depends our subjective perceptions.
* Sophists were incredibly skilled in the art of persuasion (**rhetoric**) and were often paid well. Coupled with their often avantgarde, subversive views of the world, they eventually became viewed negatively (perhaps undeservingly so). Their negative reputation was further amplified by the writing of Plato and Aristophanes. Over time, **Sophistry** became associated with fallacious arguments and deception.
  * Aristophanes viewed sophists as hairsplitting wordsmiths.
  * Plato believed sophists were avaricious instructor who taught deception. Sophist was a person who made his living through deception, whereas a philosopher was a lover of wisdom who sought the truth.



# Socrates - 500 BC

> "The unexamined life is not worth living"

Most of what we know about Socrates came from the writing of his pupil, Plato. He was famously ugly, with a pot-belly, bulging eyes and a snub nose. Despite never writing down a single line, he is still considered the most influential philosopher to have ever lived; literally demarcating philosophy into pre-Socratic, and post-Socratic Eras. 

* **Socratic Method:** Socrates believed knowledge came from within, and sought to help people "give birth" to the correct insight. He did this through a series of questions that lead participants to test their deepest assumptions and arrive at truer form of knowledge.
* **Intellectual Freedom**: His persistent questioning often shook the foundation a person's belief system. People found him exasperating. He was accused of "corrupting the youth" and "introducing new gods" and condemned to die by drinking hemlock (poison). Socrates could have easily pleaded leniency and be exiled from Athens, instead he chose not to. Socrates believed in the importance of intellectual freedom and the pursuit of knowledge even if they challenged social norms. At his trial, he supposedly uttered the famous phrase: "The unexamined life is not worth living".



# Plato - 400 BC

Plato was Socrates' pupil. We know a lot about Plato because almost all of his writings have been preserved. He founded his own school near Athens named after the Greek hero Academus: **Academy**. Plato wrote about ethics, politics, metaphysics, and other topics too numerous to list. 

* **Platonic Forms**: There are two worlds. The world of senses, and the world of ideas. Through our senses, we can only perceive fleeting and imperfect reflections of a higher reality. There exists a true reality Plato calls the eternal world of ideas (forms). 
  * Forms are abstract, perfect representations of all natural phenomena and objects. For example, every horse in the world is an imperfect representation of the ideal, perfect "idea horse"; like a gingerbread-man to its mold.

* **Allegory of the Cave**: To explain his Theory of Forms, Plato devises an analogy. Human beings are born prisoners tied to the bottom of a cave. We perceive reality through the dim reflections and shadows from lights entering from the cave's entrance. We see a tree shadow and mistake it for an actual tree. Philosophy is ultimately a journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Since our senses are fallible, we must pursue knowledge and wisdom through reason. 
* **Immortality of The Soul**: The soul is immortal and once existed in the world of forms. After the soul wakes up in a physical body, it has forgotten all the perfect forms. As such, we have a natural yearning (eros) to return to the world of forms; to exit the cave. Therefore, knowledge can be thought of as a process of *recollection*.



# Aristotle - 300 BC

> "Virtue is the golden mean between two vices: the one of excess and the other of deficiency"

To summarize Aristotle in three bullet points is a fool's errand. Throughout his life, Aristotle wrote voluminously on just about everything. In fact, he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge at the time. It wasn't until the Enlightenment that his theories started to be systematically replaced. He profoundly shaped scholarship during the middle ages, and consequently Christian theology. 

Aristotle was a pupil of Plato. He was known as "The First Teacher" amongst medieval Muslim scholars, as "The Philosopher" by St. Thomas Aquinas, and as "The Master of Those who know" by Dante. Interestingly, he also personally tutored Alexander the Great. Here are three insights from Aristotle that resonated with me the most:

* **Substance and Essence**: Aristotle disagreed with Plato on his Theory of Form. Both form (which he calls "essence") and matter exists in this world. There is no other world beyond this one. The "idea" horse we alluded to earlier is simply a concept our mind forms after seeing certain number of horses. Nothing exists in consciousness that has not first been experienced by the senses. 
  * The substance of a chicken is its physical body. The essence (or form) of a chicken is its "chicken-ness"; that it lays eggs, cackles, and flutter its wings.
* **Virtue Ethics and The Golden Mean**: Aristotle advocated the "Golden Mean" in many area of his writing from virtue ethics to politics. He noticed a pattern where the extremes are often undesirable, and that the ideal is to be found in the middle.
  * Cowardice - Courage - Rashness
  * Self-indulgence - Temperance - Insensibility
  * Shyness - Modesty - Shamelessness
  * Low self-esteem - Truthfulness - Boastfulness
* **Three Type of Souls**: All beings are composites of form and matter. For example, the soul is the form of living things. There are three types of soul according to Aristotle. Humans are special because they have all three.
  * Vegetative Soul - can grow and nourish itself (grass)
  * Sensitive Soul - can move and perceive things (animals)
  * Rational Soul - can think and reason (humans)



# Hellenistic Age - 300 BC to 30 BC

> "We suffer more in imagination than in reality" - Seneca

The Hellenistic age began with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and ended with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC. Some scholars mark the end of the Hellenistic age as 330 AD when Constantinople became the capital of the Roman Empire.

Following Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his generals into several Hellenistic kingdoms. Greek language, art, culture, architecture, and philosophy spread throughout the Hellenistic world and laid the foundation for the Roman Empire. The Hellenistic philosophers have a common interest in the inner life and the pursuit of happiness.

* **Tranquility** (Ataraxia) - Tranquility with the state of the world. Freedom from mental distress and worries due to external circumstances.
* **Self-sufficiency** (Autarky) - People and the state should strive for self-sufficiency. One should not be overly dependent on external factors for well-being.
* **Mastery of Emotions** (Apatheia) - Control over one's emotions is required for inner peace and moral virtue. Accept what is outside of one's control, and focus on what you can influence.

<u>Cynicism</u>

* Cynicism, best characterized by Diogenes who famously lived in a jar in Athens, is a school of thought that preached a simple, ascetic life as the ultimate good. The cynics lived in accordance with nature **unbounded by social convention**, and rejected all material possessions and desires such as wealth, power, glory, status, etc.
* Over the centuries, Cynicism became associated with its negative aspect, most notably the shameless nonconformity. Contemporary definition of cynicism refers to an attitude of distrust, or lack of faith in the sincerity and goodness of others.
  * Cynicism - distrust by prudence
  * Pessimism - distrust of potential success
  * Nihilism - distrust of of meaning in life

<u>Epicureanism</u>

* Epicureanism, established by Epicurus in 307 BC, made **pleasure as the ultimate good**. However, the Epicureans also believed in pleasure within constraint. Short term pleasure must be balanced with greater, more lasting long-term ones. Followers of Epicureanism generally withdrew from politics to limit their ambition and attain a greater peace of mind.
* Although the seeking of pleasure is at the heart of Epicureanism, it should not be confused with hedonism (a common mistake in modern usage). Epicureans practiced moderation, and generally avoided excesses and overindulgences, yet they are connoisseurs of arts and simple pleasures, and are open to occasional luxury.


<u>Stoicism</u>

* Stoicism, established by Zeno of Citium around 300 BC, preached **virtue as the highest good**. To live a good life, one should cultivate inner resilience, be free from passions, and not be disturbed by external events beyond one's control. Unlike Epicureans who believed in avoiding pain, stoics believed in enduring pain.

Let's look at an example to solidify our understanding of the three major Hellenistic philosophies. Suppose a person suddenly lost their job.

* A Cynic might choose to "escape the 9-5 rat race" and never work a corporate job again. They'd reject, and thus be freed from societal norms such as having a stable career, settling down, and starting a family. In short, they'd choose to live in accordance with their understanding of a natural/authentic life unconstrained by what society dictates is best. Perhaps they might start their own business, or become a digital nomad that works and lives in a van.
* An Epicurean would spend the down time with friends and families, use their severance package to enjoy some travel and good food, then ultimately find a smaller, simpler job that contributes to a more tranquil life with simpler pleasures.
* A Stoic would embrace the setback and not dwell on external circumstances. Rather than complaining about their ill-fortunate, they'd view it as a good character-building exercise. They go on the job hunt the next day, posting resumes in the morning then going on morning runs to cultivate their fitness during the down time. In short, they would focus on developing resilience, inner strength, and maintaining a sense of virtue or "stiff upper lip" in the face of adversity.



# Christianity - 1 BC

> "The last shall be first, and the first shall be last"

A summary of the development of the Western World is incomplete without a few paragraphs on Christianity, for it will be the focus of study for the entirety of the middle ages.

* There were two cultures important to the development of Western Civilization: Indo-Europeans and Semites.
  * **Indo-Europeans** lived around the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea about 4000 years ago. They believed in many gods (**polytheism**). Greek philosophy, Norse mythology, and both oriental religions (Hinduism and Buddhism) all originated in the Indo-European sphere. They all have a leaning towards a philosophic, speculative view of the world. They also have a cyclic view of history; that there is no beginning and no end and that there exists an eternal interplay of life and death.
  * **Semites** originated in the Arabian Peninsula. All three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) share a semitic background. The Semites believed in one God (**monotheism**) and a linear view of history; where one day history will end (judgement day). Judaism was the first of the Abrahamic religions; the Old Testament was written around 700 BC. Christianity is a direct descendent of Judaism with Hellenistic influences; its New Testament was written around 100 AD. The Quran of Islam was written around 600 AD.
* Important events in Christianity:
  * God created the world.
  * Soon after, mankind began to rebel. **Adam and Eve** were driven out of the Garden of Eden and death came to the world.
  * Around 2000 BC, **Abraham** - the founding Hebrew patriarch - made a covenant with God which guaranteed protection for his descendants. 
    * He is the spiritual progenitor for all believers in Christianity
    * He is the connection between Jews and God in Judaism
    * He is a link in the chain of Islamic prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad.
    * His son Ishmael is an important figure in Islam. His other son Isaac is an important figure in Judaism.
  * Around 1200 BC, Moses receives the **Ten Commandments** (e.g. Thou Shalt Not Kill) on Mount Sinai. Around this time, the Israelites had long been held as slaves in Egypt. Along with God's help, Moses led the Jews back to the land of Israel.
  * In 722 BC, Israel was divided into a Northern Kingdom (Israel) and Southern Kingdom (Judea). Israel was conquered by the Assyrians, and Judea was conquered by the Babylonians, marking the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora.
  * Around 6 BC, **Jesus of Nazareth** was born (Christmas). He was a Galilean jew who started his own ministry and quickly gained followers. He claimed to be the "Messiah" but was ultimately arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem and turned to the Roman Government.
  * Around 33 AD, Jesus was crucified (Good Friday). Three day after, he was resurrected from the dead (Easter Monday)
  * Soon after Jesus' death, **Paul the Apostle** traveled throughout the Greco-Roman world on many missionary journeys. He spread the teaching of Jesus and was instrumental in the writing of the New Testament.
  * Christians faced persecution throughout the Roman Empire until emperor Theodosius made Christianity the **official religion of the Roman Empire** and thus most of the western world.
  * Over time, a **East-West Schism** occurred due to theological and cultural differences. The church was split into Eastern Orthodoxy (centered in Constantinople or modern-day Istanbul) and Western Catholic Church (Centered in Rome) in 1054.
  * During the 14th century, dissatisfaction with the Roman Catholic church lead to another schism known as the **Protestant Reformation**, splitting the church further into Catholicism, and Protestantism.
* The **modern calendar** dating system is based on the approximate birth of Jesus Christ. Note that he was born around 6 BC. Dating of ancient historical events are often imprecise. Furthermore, the dating system itself was established centuries after Jesus' death.
  * AD = Anno Domini, Latin for In the year of our lord (e.g. 2023 AD is short for the "In the 2023th year of our lord")
  * BC = Before Christ
  * CE = Common Era (secular version of AD)
  * BCE = Before Common Era (secular version of BC)



# The Middle Ages - 500 AD to 1500 AD

> "To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible." - St. Thomas Aquinas

The middle ages, sometimes referred to as the **"Dark Ages"**, is a period extending from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 5th Century to the Renaissance. After the Roman Empire's retreat from Europe, the church assumed governmental administrative responsibilities in place of the empire. In the span of roughly a thousand years, Christianity became the predominant philosophy of life. The focus of philosophical inquiries was placed exclusively on the **integration of faith and reason.** 

The most prominent philosopher of this era was **St. Thomas Aquinas**, who attempted to reconcile Christian Theology with the philosophies of Aristotle. He believed that truth could be reached both through reason, and through God.

During this time, the Arabs became predominant in chemistry, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics (think Arabic numerals, algebra, algorithm). The renaissance humanists would later consider this period as a barbaric age, a civilizational low between classic antiquity and the renaissance. To the dismay of many archeologists, many of the ancient Roman and Greek artifacts were demolished and repurposed as building material during this time.



# Protestant Reformation - 1500 AD

Leading up to the 15th century, Europe experienced many calamities such as floods, severe droughts, famine, and the Black Death which killed 1/3 of the European population. There were peasant revolts, witch hunts, and general unrest. Many thought we have strayed from God, many others were dissatisfied with the abuse and corruption of the Roman Church authorities.

One of the most well known abuse by the church was the **sale of indulgences**; certificates that promised remission or reduction of time in purgatory on the way to heaven. Although Indulgences can also be obtained through other means such as acts of piety, making pilgrims, and performing certain good work, the monetary aspect of indulgence made it ripe for financial exploitation. Many dutiful Christians gave their life-savings to the church so that the punishment for their sin - or those of their relatives - can be reduced or forgiven. Sale of indulgences became a lucrative source of revenue for the Church, who used it to fund the construction of St. Peter's Basilica. 

In 1517, **Martin Luther**, dissatisfied with the Roman Catholic Church's abuse and corruption, composed and nailed the **Ninety-Five Theses** to the castle door in Wittenberg. Furthermore, he translated the Bible from Latin - an esoteric language only accessible by preachers and academics - to vernacular German. God's words were henceforth to be interpreted by the people, rather a selected few. As you can probably imagine, this was incredibly revolutionary. Many were tried and tortured for heresy during this tumultuous period. Eventually, Christianity was split into two: **Catholicism** with the Roman Pope serving as at the top, and **Protestantism** which emphasized faith and the Bible alone as the source of divine revelations. 



# Renaissance - 1500 AD

> "Man looked for new foundations" - Hans Kohn

The Renaissance (French for "rebirth") was a period of significant cultural, artistic, and intellectual progress. Although there is considerable overlap with the late Middle Ages (happening concurrently with the Protestant Reformation), most scholars place the start of the Renaissance around the 14th century in Italy. It would later spread to the rest of Europe, reaching its peak between 1490s and 1520s. The Renaissance marked the transition between the Middle Ages and Modernity. 

A confluence of factors lead to the birth of the Renaissance. Firstly, the **Black Death** upended societal structures across Europe and acted much like a reset button. For instance, the population of Florence was nearly halved in 1347. Land value dropped up to 40%. The working class enjoyed more freedom and many traveled for the most economically favorable positions. Secondly, there was a **flourishing of commerce in Italy**. Unlike absolute monarchs of European states, Italy at the time was politically fragmented into city states that allowed for competition. Furthermore, Italy is located in the center of the Mediterranean, making it the ideal hub for trade and commerce. Cities like Florence became incredibly wealthy, fostering an environment conducive to cultural and artistic creativity. Wealthy patrons such as the Medici family funded artists and scholars (like Leonardo Da Vinci) and encouraged them to pursue their creative endeavors. Lastly, the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 led to mass **emigration of Greek scholars** to Italian cities. The influx of ancient manuscripts played a role in reviving interest in classical texts. Scholars began exploring classical texts directly from the original source rather than relying on Medieval translations. The invention of the printing press further accelerated the dissemination of these texts.

The Renaissance is perhaps best known for its art. Renaissance art employed realistic linear perspective and portrayal of light and shadow, and contained subjects from both religious and classical Greek/Roman themes. The artistic and scientific contribution of polymathic figures such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo inspired the term **"Renaissance man"**. 

The revival of interest in Classical literature and ideals also led to an intellectual movement known as **Humanism**; a human-centered worldview that celebrated individual achievements, potential, and virtue. Renaissance humanists sought to create a citizenry that can speak and write with eloquence, thus capable of engaging in civic duties. It should be noted that while Humanism is more secular in some respects, most humanist are nevertheless Christians. It wouldn't be until the Enlightenment that secularism gained more prominence.

The number of fundamental, world-changing scientific achievements during the Renaissance is too numerous to list. In 1440, the printing press was invented. In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered the new world, sparking the Age of Discovery. In 1494, Luca Pacioli formalized modern accounting (double-entry bookkeeping). In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric view of the universe.
