# Hello Fresh - Week 1 Journal

I just started using this subscription meal kit service called "Hello Fresh". In essence, each week, they deliver to you a box of groceries and recipe cards; thus saving you from a grocery trip and finding the right ingredients. 

With the promotion going on currently, Each serving is about 8 dollars, I think the normal price is around 11 dollars per meal. Some people might find that expensive, but It's actually a lot cheaper than my usual spending habits where I spend at least 30 dollars a day on take out.

Furthermore, I find that at least for me, "Hello Fresh" forces me to change my diet and try different meals and type of cuisine. I am trying to eat healthy this year. Normally my unimaginative brain just picks from a list of five meals I always have... Since everything is pre-packaged, I find that I am also wasting a lot less food than I normally would. No more unnecessary stress of worrying about food going bad in the fridge.

The only con I see right now is the time it takes to cut, cook, and clean. I honestly find cutting and cooking kind of entertaining, but I absolutely dread dish-cleaning. Since I only have a few plates and cutleries, it doesn't make sense to use the dish-washer for 2 plates and a fork. Additionally, since I'll be needing those plates the next day, I can't really pile dishes into it either.

## Meal 1: Creamy Chicken & Mushroom Cavatappi

Taste: :star::star::star::star::star: (5/5)

Prep Time: :star::star::star::star: (4/5)

<u>Notes and things to watch out for:</u>

* If you have other recipe that calls for chicken in your weekly order, make sure to pick out the pre-cut chicken. 
* Tastes good but a lot of starch and cream. Not good for weight-watchers
* Could use more chicken. A lot of pasta but the pasta sauce is too good.

## Meal 2: Shawarma-Spiced Chicken

Prep Time: :star: :star: :star: :star: (4/5)

<u>Notes and things to watch out for:</u>

* If you have other recipe that calls for chicken in your weekly order, make sure to pick out the whole chicken, not the pre-cut ones
* The package for sour cream and yogurt looks the same. Make sure to read the fine print. Also they tell you to use half of the yogurt for seasoning, half for sauce.
* Easy to make, but rice is just rice, the salad tastes okay but it's not any different than the ones I get from Mediterranean restaurants. The chicken is the highlight, which says a lot about this recipe. The shawarma seasoning is nice but you could have seasoned it any other way. This recipe is literally just rice, salad, and seasoned chicken. 

## Meal 3: Refried Black Beam & Poblano Flautas

Prep Time: :star::star::star: (3/5)

<u>Notes and things to watch out for:</u>

* Make sure you have a can-opener at home. I didn't have one and had to use a knife to pry open the can of beans. Not very safe.
* Takes a while to make and assemble. Tastes pretty good. I like the Pico, guacamole, and sour cream topping as well as the Poblano peppers. This is a vegetarian meal but it is definitely packing a lot of calories and starch. You can make six of these but you'll be full after two... It is really dense. Maybe too dense...
