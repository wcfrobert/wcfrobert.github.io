The world is full of smart people. But what do we mean by "smart" anyways? My refrigerator is smart because it has a screen on it. What about people? What makes a person "smart"? 

Personally, I've never really thought of myself as "smart". Through observation, I knew I was not cut out for things like theoretical physics, or graduate level abstract mathematics. But I also knew they were not impossible if I decide to dedicate a huge amount of time and effort. I just happen to focus my time on other productive pursuits like paint-by-numbers and trying & failing to form a morning run habit for 27 years in a row.

You see, I am a firm believer in anti-determinism. Human adaptability is god's greatest gift. Through deliberate practice, proclivities can be manufactured, passions born, excellence attained, and fates molded. In the long run, it is the ones who practice more who prevail, not the ones who had some initial advantage in intelligence or some other talent. I believe anyone, regardless of circumstance, can be incredibly skilled at something if they try hard enough for long enough (see Malcom Gladwell's 10,000 hours). Let's say you have a classmate who completes complicated math p-sets in 30 minutes when it takes others 2 full days. Is he smart? I think so! Maybe he loves math and has been attending math Olympiad classes since 6th grade. Naturally he is more skilled than you and your other classmates. If you had the same passion, same amount of training, then I'd wager that you could do the same. 

Here's an amusing analogy. Think of your achievements, laurels, medals, distinctions as **distance** from the starting line. Think of your skills in things like math, writing, programming, tennis, and etc. as **velocity**. Lastly, think of how fast you are able to learn and think on the fly as **acceleration**. We often mistake a person's extraordinary skill (velocity) with intelligence or talent (acceleration). But the truth is most people can drive fast if they press on the gas pedal long enough. Collectively, I think we should value "velocity" over "acceleration", and not be so preoccupied with "distance". (if that made any sense at all...)

Perhaps if we normalized by the amount of prior experience, we can get a better measure of intelligence. But the crucial question to ask at that point is if that's at all useful...

We live in such a multi-faceted world. I prefer to think we are all "smart" in something because we choose to dedicate our time in different things. Everyone has their unique set of proclivities and passions. Of course some skills are financially more desirable than others, perhaps disproportionally so. But I hesitate to think of the wholeness of life as a singular competition. If it is, then it probably most resembles "Little Miss Sunshine"; grotesque, and ultimately meaningless. What a dreadful, colorless world it would be if everyone competed on the same spectrum. 

He might be a programming wiz, but maybe he can't cook an egg without a fire extinguisher. She might have a PhD in machine learning and AI, but maybe she lacks the emotional intelligence to get along with team-members and manage relationships. 

> "A species in which everyone was General Patton would not succeed, any more than would a race in which everyone was Vincent van Gogh. I prefer to think that the planet needs athletes, philosophers, sex symbols, painters, scientists; it needs the warmhearted, the hardhearted, the coldhearted, and the weakhearted. It needs those who can devote their lives to studying how many droplets of water are secreted by the salivary glands of dogs under which circumstances, and it needs those who can capture the passing impression of cherry blossoms in a fourteen-syllable poem or devote twenty-five pages to the dissection of a small boyâ€™s feelings as he lies in bed in the dark waiting for his mother to kiss him goodnight" - Susan Cain

Generalists have great breadth of knowledge; Jack of all trade, master of none. Specialists have great depth of knowledge; a mile deep but 3 inches in diameter. No one knows everything about everything. No one person can make something as mundane as a pencil all by themselves (even though you can buy a dozen for 2 dollars at Staples). The infinite complexity of our modern world only works because we rely on each other, and trust each other for our unique skills and expertise. How beautiful and inspiring!

Growing up, I've never thought of myself as the smartest in the room (unless I was the only one in the room). Nowadays, I see myself as a Honda CR-V. Abysmal acceleration. A soccer-mom car. Even though I don't have the quickest 0-to-60, I can still drive darn fast!

With all of that in mind, I think yes indeed! The world is full of smart people.
