The world is full of incredibly smart people.

But wait... What do we mean by "smart" anyways? My fridge is smart because it has a screen on it. What about people? What makes a person "smart"? 

For me personally, I've never really thought of myself as "smart". In fact, through observation, I knew I was not cut out for things like theoretical physics, or graduate level abstract mathematics. But I also knew they were *not* impossible should I choose to dedicate a huge amount of time and effort. Instead, I chose to focus my time on other productive pursuits like paint-by-numbers and learning to flip my pancake without using a spatula.

That one classmate who cranks out programming p-sets in 30 minutes when it takes others 2 full days. Is he smart? For all intents and purposes imaginable, I think yes! Let's say he's been obsessed with programming since he was 6 years old, and that he's attended competitive programming classes every day after school since 8th grade. If you had the same passion, same amount of training and prior experience, would you also be considered smart? Again, I'd say yes!

If we can somehow normalized the amount of prior experience, then perhaps we can get a better measure. But the crucial question to ask at that point is if it's at all useful that we do...

I am a firm believer in anti-determinism and excellence through practice. We live in such a multi-faceted world. We are all "smart" in something because we choose to dedicate our time towards different things. Everyone has their unique set of interests and passions. Of course some skills are more desired economically than others, but I hesitate to think of the wholeness of life as a singular competition. If it is, then it probably most resembles "Little Miss Sunshine"; grotesque, and ultimately meaningless. 

Psychologists invent measures like intelligence quotient, but with the exception of extreme cases, I'd argue that IQ is too narrow to capture the vividness of the human experience. He might be a programming wizard, but maybe he can't cook an egg without a fire extinguisher and a shovel. She might have a PhD in machine learning and AI, but maybe she lacks the emotional intelligence to get along with team-members and manage relationships. 

Generalists have great breadth of knowledge. Jack of all trade; master of none. 

Specialists have great depth of knowledge; a mile deep but about 3 inches in diameter. 

No one knows everything about everything. And I think that's undeniably a good thing.

> "A species in which everyone was General Patton would not succeed, any more than would a race in which everyone was Vincent van Gogh. I prefer to think that the planet needs athletes, philosophers, sex symbols, painters, scientists; it needs the warmhearted, the hardhearted, the coldhearted, and the weakhearted. It needs those who can devote their lives to studying how many droplets of water are secreted by the salivary glands of dogs under which circumstances, and it needs those who can capture the passing impression of cherry blossoms in a fourteen-syllable poem or devote twenty-five pages to the dissection of a small boyâ€™s feelings as he lies in bed in the dark waiting for his mother to kiss him goodnight" - Susan Cain

With all of that in mind, I think yes! The world is indeed full of incredibly smart people. 



## An Interesting Analogy

Inevitably, someone will point to examples like Albert Einstein, or Jon Von Neuman. Yes, exceptions do exist. Every bell curve has two tails. There are people who knows a lot about a lot. But through my 27 years of living on this planet, I think they appear with about the same frequency as seeing a Lamborghini on the road. Depending on where you live, you might see one once a month, or once a year. Most people are driving Hondas and Toyotas! 

I think have an amusingly apt analogy to describe intelligence.

* Distance (from the starting line)
  * Your achievements, laurels, medals, distinctions
* Velocity
  * Your skills in things like math, writing, programming, tennis, playing the piano
* Acceleration
  * How fast you are able to learn, use your wit, and think on the fly.

We often mistake a person's extraordinary skill (velocity) with intelligence or talent (acceleration). But the truth is most people can drive fast if they press on the gas pedal long enough. Collectively, I think we should value "velocity" over "acceleration", and not be so preoccupied with "distance". (if that makes any sense at all...)

Growing up, I've never thought of myself as the smartest in the room (unless I was the only one in the room). Perhaps that's a sign of maturity at an young age. More likely though, it was because I had self-esteem issues as a kid. I like to see myself as a Honda CRV. Abysmal acceleration. A soccer-mom car. But most of the car you see speeding on the highway are SUVs anyways. I might not have a quick 0-to-60, but I can still drive darn fast!
