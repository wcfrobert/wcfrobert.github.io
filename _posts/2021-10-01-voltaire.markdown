In light of the tragic earthquake in Haiti, a famous poem by Voltaire came to my mind. "Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne", or "Poem on the Disaster of Lisbon" is about the the great Lisbon earthquake in 1755.

> Unlucky mortals! O deplorable earth!

> All humanity huddles in fear!

> The endless subject of useless pain!

> Come philosophers who cry, "All is well,"

> And contemplate the ruins of this world.

> Behold the debris and ashes of the fallen - 

> These women and children heaped in common ruin,

> These scattered limbs under the broken marble.

> See the hundred thousand whom the earth devours!

> Torn and bloody, they are still breathing,

> Entombed beneath roofs, and they die without

> Relief from the horror of their suffering lives.

> As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond

> To this appalling spectacle of smoldering ashes with:

> "This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws freely chosen by God?"

> Seeing this mass of victims, will you say,

> "God is avenged. Their death is the price of their crimes"?

> What crime, what fault had the young committed,

> Who lie bleeding at their mother's breast?

> DId the fallen Lisbon indulge in more vices

> Than Long or Paris, which live in pleasure?

> Lisbon is no more but they dance in paris.
