## Julius Caesar

Julius Caesar, while serving his quaestorship in Hispania (modern day Spain), was said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great. Standing before the statue, he suddenly wept...

> "Alexander had conquered the known world before the age of 33. What have I done with my life?"

Of course, this was before he would go on to achieve victory against the Gauls in the Gallic wars, before he would go on to declare civil war by crossing the Rubicon, and before he would single handedly change the fate of the Roman Republic.

Stories like these are so delightful. Not only do they add a human element to historical great figures that can otherwise seem mythological, they also add a layer of drama that give history so much color and emotion.

Caesars' profound self-contempt, and ambition to strive for more is perhaps more inspiring and relatable than Alexander. Alexander was handed the most powerful military at the age 20 when his father, king Philip II, was assassinated. He was born into royalty and was tutored by Aristotle. Although Alexander was a formidable individual by all accounts, he was in some ways destined for greatness. By comparison, Caesar went from essentially exiled at age of 16, to slowly climbing the Roman political system, to ultimately becoming the most powerful figure in the Roman Republic.

## Leonardo Da Vinci

Leonardo Da Vinci was also no stranger to inner turmoil. Although he rarely divulged explicitly on his own emotions in his notebook, we occasionally catch a glimpse of gloom through his expressions and artistic sketches.

In 1480, at the age of 28, Leonardo had already shown signs of brilliance. It was said that while working as a pupil under Andrea del Verrocchio on the painting "The Baptism of Christ", his genius - from his understanding of color, lighting, skin tones, movement, to the subtle and scientifically accurate water ripples -  so far outclassed that of Verrocchio that he allegedly quit painting forever. The veracity of this story is debated but what's known for certain is that Verrocchio did suddenly stop outputting paintings afterwards.

However, one trait that plagued Leonardo was his perfectionism. He often abandons his works of art halfway, only to resume decades later when he learns of some new technique or scientific fact. His pursuit of beauty and perfection seemed to overwhelmed him. As Leonardo turned 30 years of age, he had indeed established his genius, but had remarkably little to show for it publicly. His inability to finish two paintings, "Adoration of the Magi" and "Saint Jerome" may have made him depressed and melancholic. Here are some expressions jotted down in his notebook around the same time.

> "Tell me if anything was ever done... Tell me... Tell me"

> "While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die"

> "There is no perfect gift without great suffering. Our glories and our triumphs pass away"

On one sheet, he quotes a passage from Dante's Inferno:

> "Put off this sloth," the master said, "for shame!

> Sitting on feather pillows, lying reclined

> Beneath the blanket is no way to fame - 

> Fame, without which man's life wastes out of mind,

> Leaving on earth no more memorial

> Than foam in water or smoke upon the wind
