## Why Build a Website?

It is difficult to pinpoint the impetus for me to make this website, it could be a whole myriad of reasons instead of a single "oh yes. I should do that" moment. 

It could be for personal branding. Having a personal portfolio is quite common in some industries like architecture, data-science, front-end web development, graphic design, etc.

It could be because I've always been interested in web development, design, and calligraphy. Setting up a website from scratch is an interesting mix of arts and engineering. I don't think I would do it for a living, but it certainly appeals to me as a hobby. I enjoy making things that are great in both form and function.

It could be for personal improvement and to keep my mind active. The internet is essentially how we interact with the world today. And I thought it behooved me to understand it a little better and pick up a new skill along the way.

Lastly, on a more morbid note. I recently read Ernest Becker's "Denial of Death" and pretty much had an existential crisis. Perhaps this is a rational response to my crushing need to be liked and remembered rather than forgotten in the passage of time. They say you die twice. The first time is when you physically stop breathing, and the second time is the last time someone utters your name. Like the handprints in Argentina's Cueva de Las Manos, this website is my handprint on the internet. I wanted a small slice of the internet for myself where I can say "Hi! My name is Robert, and I did stuff. I am great. I contain multitudes". I guess you could call it my immortality project.

## Why Not Use CMS like WordPress, Wix, SquareSpace?
Once I decided to make a website, the next question is "how?"

What you probably don't know just by looking at this website is just how long it took me to get started... Originally I thought of using WordPress like anybody else. In fact I had created a prototype in WordPress. But I thought I would be missing out on an excellent learning opportunity. So I went to Jekyll + Github and tried out several existing Jekyll themes. I didn't particularly like any of them. In the end, I decided to create my own website from scratch by first learning HTML, CSS, and JS. The entire process of first opening up a HTML tutorial to finalizing this website took about 4 months. It would have taken me about 2 weeks If I had decided to make my website in WordPress. But I would have missed out on some additional customization as well as the learning opportunity.

Unlike those data science portfolio websites, I am reluctant to make it entirely a rigid online resume of sorts. The type where I refer to myself in the third-person and plainly state my experiences and achievements. I would rather inject it with my personality and DNA and have a bit of color. This is another reason why I opted to code everything myself rather than using existing templates on Jekyll, or using a CMS like WordPress or Wix. With some additional effort, I can really call this website my own.



## The Smallest Dog...

I showed the website to my parents, and to my surprise (but in hindsight not that surprising), they were a little put off by the excessive self-promotion of a personal website. I think it is very foreign for their generation and I completely understand that. In fact, I was a little put off initially as well. There is a famous saying in the South that goes like this:

> The smallest dog barks the loudest

The quote is meant to poke fun at Napoleon Complex, where people who are more insecure with their ability tends to boast the most. A confident man doesn't feel the need to prove he is confident. A rich man does not need to prove he is rich, and so on... The implication being if one is competent enough, his/her skill will speak for itself. I suppose I am neither rich nor competent.

While I agree with the sentiment, I think it is foolish to just work hard and hope you will not be overlooked. Maybe I'll have less to prove once I am older. For now, I think a little self-promotion is necessary. 

The necessity of self promotion is self-evident in competitive fields like web design and data science. The vastness of the digital economy really took me by surprise while I was learning about web design. Unlike a typical engineering job where you are looking for a position within a certain geographic proximity, jobs in the digital economy does not have boundaries. I've seen Vietnamese graphic designers, Ukrainian web developers, Finnish photographers, Indian drafters, etc. It is all very interesting, but also somewhat unsettling. Could non-manufacturing jobs be outsourced as well in the near future? The prospect of outsourcing "white collar jobs" used to be stymied by, distance and language barrier. But now with such a globalized world, one where COVID has demonstrated not only the viability, not also desirability, of working entirely remotely, what separates working 10 miles away from the office to 1000 miles away? It's a brave new world...

Lastly, I want to bring up another famous saying: "If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" In the same vein, although not really an epistemological observation, if you had some great experiences or achievements, but you don't record it down, do they even exist?
