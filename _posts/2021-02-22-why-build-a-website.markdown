## Preface

As I was writing this, I realized just how momentous it is to finally have my own website. At the same time, it occurred to me that every word I type down will be on the internet! My writing skill is sub par so It is terrifying to have almost a "finality" to it. Yes, I can always delete my website, but everything leaves a digital footprint on the web. I always cringe when looking back on my older writings. I think it is an inevitable part of growth. I fully embrace it. In fact, maybe that should be my motto from now on: I will strive to write things that will make me cringe in a years time.

One caveat is that since my website may be visited by friends, potential employers or business partners, I need to be extra careful of what I write. You won't find any politics here.

## Why Build a Website?

It is difficult to pinpoint what exactly inspired me to start this website, it's possible that the impetus stemmed from a whole myriad of reasons instead of a single "oh yes. I should do that" moment. 

One potential reason is the various articles and videos I read/watched on personal branding, and how to "toot your horns without blowing it". The idea is not novel by any means. For instance, it is essential for people like graphic designers, or architects to showcase their work. I questioned why it is not more common for other industries. Indeed, there appears to be a huge swath of personal websites set up by designers, academics, and software engineers/data scientists.

Unlike those data science portfolio websites, I am reluctant to make it entirely a rigid online resume of sorts. The type where I refer to myself in the third-person and plainly state my experiences and achievements. I would rather inject it with my personality and DNA and have a bit of color. This is precisely the reason why I opted to code everything myself rather than using existing templates on Jekyll, or using a CMS like WordPress or Wix. Building a website from scratch is a lot more fun and I really get to call it my own. I want to carve out a small slice of the internet for myself. I guess you could call it my immortality project (Ernest Becker's Denial of Death).

Lastly, I've always been interested in web development, design, and calligraphy. Setting up a website from scratch is an interesting mix of arts and engineering. I don't think I would do it for a living, but it certainly appeals to me as a hobby. Here are the color palettes and typography used for my website. Pretty neat right?

## The Smallest Dog...

I showed the website to my parents, and to my surprise (but in hindsight not that surprising), they were a little put off by the excessive self-promotion of a personal website. I think it is very foreign for their generation and I completely understand that. In fact, I was a little put off initially as well. There is a famous saying in the South that goes like this:

> The smallest dog barks the loudest

The quote is meant to poke fun at Napoleon Complex, where people who are more insecure with their ability tends to boast the most. A confident man doesn't feel the need to prove he is confident. A rich man does not need to prove he is rich, and so on... The implication being if one is competent enough, his/her skill will speak for itself. I suppose I am neither rich nor competent.

While I agree with the sentiment, I think it is foolish to just work hard and hope you will not be overlooked. Unless you are a genius, which most of us are not, I think a little bit of self-promotion is necessary. 

The necessity of self promotion is self-evident in competitive fields like web design and data science. The vastness of the digital economy really took me by surprise while I was designing my website. Unlike a typical engineering job where you are looking for a position within a certain geographic proximity, jobs in the digital economy does not have boundaries. I've seen Vietnamese graphic designers, Ukrainian web developers, Finnish photographers, Indian drafters, etc. It is all very interesting, but also somewhat unsettling. Could non-manufacturing jobs be outsourced as well in the near future? The prospect of outsourcing "white collar jobs" used to be stymied by, well, physical distance. But now that COVID has demonstrated not only the viability, not also desirability, of working entirely remotely, what separates working 10 miles away from the office to 1000 miles away? It's a brave new world...

If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? In the same vein, although no where near as philosophical, if you do not record your experiences and achievements, do they even exist?
