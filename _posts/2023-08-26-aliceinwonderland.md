> "It seems very pretty, but it is very hard to understand!" - Alice after reading the Jabberwocky poem.

Reading "Alice in Wonderland", and its sequel "Through a Looking Glass" was in equal part amusing and disorienting. I spent a Saturday afternoon diving into the rabbit hole, as the saying goes. The whole affair felt like a fever dream. In some strange, indescribable way, I quite enjoyed it. How fantastical! How nonsensical!

To give some context, Alice in Wonderland is a famous 1865 children's novel by Lewis Carroll. Its influence on popular culture, children's story, and the fantasy genre can hardly be overstated. It has been translated into 174 languages and there are hundreds of screen adaptions, musicals, ballets, operas, etc. Given it's cultural impact, I thought it behooved me to read it. 

I can't really describe the plot in full, despite having read it 2 hours ago. In the first book, Alice fell down a rabbit hole (chasing a rabbit in waistcoat) and adventure ensues. In the second book, Alice fell through a mirror, and adventure ensues. There were talking poker cards, a smiling cat, a baby that turned into a pig, a croquet game played with flamingos and hedgehogs, and Alice who kept growing and shrinking in size for some reason.

Reading some of the literary dissection online, I learned of an interesting concept known as **literary nonsense**. It is a deliberate artistic choice whereby writers inject nonsensical elements to provoke thoughts, explore boundary of language and meaning, and create a sense of playfulness. It is different from actual nonsense in that it is intentional and serves a literary purpose. If I hadn't read Lewis Carroll, I wouldn't have appreciated literary nonsense. In fact, I probably would've derided it.

By injecting his story with literary nonsense, Lewis Carroll created a world accentuated by a sense of playfulness, and a fantastical creativity unbounded by conventions. Children throughout the ages love it. Many commentators note that Alice in Wonderland represents a departure from an era of didacticism in children literature, where the goal was to instruct rather than entertain.

"Alice in Wonderland" evoked in me a sense of wonder, but also a sense of confusion and discomfort. I felt the child in me being pulled, like Alice, into a fantastical, whimsical world. Yet the adult in me kept pulling me back out. Maybe I've lost some of that childish wonder and curiosity. Why should everything make sense anyways? Why must a story have a narrative structure? Sometimes random things happen for no particular reason.

What does it mean for something to make sense anyways? As I am writing this, I feel myself getting hungry. I am eagerly waiting to have dinner. Isn't the real world equally absurd? Why am I waiting for this rock floating around in space around a giant fireball to rotate to a specific angle, so that I can nourish myself with plants and animals delicately arranged on a plate?

Our curiosity of the world seems to vanish as we get older. Everything seems to be explainable by science. No, silly goose, thunder isn't caused by a hammer-swinging Norse god fighting giants. It's the result of buildup of electrical charges in the atmosphere due to movement of water droplets whereby electrons are transferred leading to separation of positive and negative charges. Eventually a difference in electrical potential builds up between the ground on the sky and the electric field becomes strong enough to overcome the insulating properties of air resulting in rapid discharge of electricity as it zigzags through the air, heating it up to immense temperatures which causes shockwaves that we hear as thunder.

Does science enrich or diminish our sense of wonder about the world. I think the answer depends on your age. What's less debatable in my opinion, is that science is a huge drain of curiosity. I have no idea how computer processors work, but I know some "scientist" out there does so I need not bother.

Maybe there is wisdom in embracing serendipity, and in trying hard to regain that childish sense of wonder and curiosity about absolutely everything. I'm reminded of Nietzsche's three metamorphoses. Isn't it though-provoking that the final stage of self-overcoming is to become a child again.

> But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?

> Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, and a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.
>
> Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: *its own* will, willeth now the spirit; *his own* world winneth the world's outcast
