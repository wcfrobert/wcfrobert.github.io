> "Moody entry today... I don't like my current self. To be honest, I feel quite miserable"

That was the start of one of my journal entry three months ago. A whole slew of unfortunate events happened earlier this year that has brought me much sadness. Aside from life's slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, I felt sluggish and unmotivated. On weekday evenings, after work, I waste majority of my time distracting myself with social media and video games. On weekends, in the midst of the most gorgeous Californian weather, I am either binging TV shows, or I find myself toiling away solving dynamic programming puzzles and reversing linked-lists. This is not the life I wanted. I recall thinking to myself.

That was three months ago. I am happy to report that I've since lost 10 lbs. I am able to fit in my old pants again (although just barely), and I've developed much better eating and exercise habits. Although it's not perfect , and I doubt it will ever be, I am in a much better place both physically and mentally. 

<u>The Happiness Diet</u>

After reading Anna Lembke's excellent book: '"Dopamine Nation" , I decided to cut back on highly stimulating activities and live a more "ascetic" lifestyle. I don't mean living like a monk (although I did shave my head bald), my intent was to regain balance in this age of indulgence and fully appreciate again the simple pleasures in life.

Rather than "living to eat", I've switched to a life of "eating to live". As Benjamin Franklin once said: "Eat, but not to dullness". I also went on a diet and replaced much of my junk food intake with more nutritious, whole foods. On weekends, I've replaced my usual TV show binge with hiking and rock-climbing.

And perhaps most importantly, an action that I believe would invariably improve everyone's life:

<u>Quitting Social Media. Digital Detox</u>

>  If we desire a future that avoids the enslavement of the propaganda state as well as the narcosis of the consumer and celebrity culture, we must first acknowledge the preciousness of our attention and resolve not to part with it so cheaply and unthinkingly as we so often have. And then we must act, individually and collectively, to make our attention our own again, and so reclaim ownership of The very experience of living. - Tim Wu in " The Attention Merchant"

I think most of us would agree that too much social media can be harmful to our mental health. In this case, however, I am speaking much more generally in that I am avoiding *all forms of entertainment on our digital devices*. I will simply not allow myself to be entertained by my computer or cellphone.

It was quite a startling discovery when I found out that I was wasting up to 17 hours a week on my smartphone. That is almost 900 hours a year (almost an entire month of time staring at a screen!) Imagine regaining a month of your life each year.

Here is a comparison of my smartphone usage before and after:

With the extra month I've gained each year, I started reading again, I reconnected with friends, found new hobbies, and revived old ones. Rather than scrolling through YouTube, I started exploring the beautiful landscape of California through hiking and weekly road trips. I started attending more social events and coworker happy hours. In short, I resumed the very act of living.

I think most people are self-aware enough to know when something has to change. I am not here to sell you some generic self-help advice. I think most people know what they *should* do. Yet the challenge lies not in knowing, but in actually doing. If it were as simple as knowing, then the self-help book industry would cease to exist. I am extremely grateful to have encountered something that worked so well for me at the nadir of my misery. But what worked for me might not work for everyone else. I do hope everyone finds the thing that works for them during challenging times.

That being said, I feel more well-adjusted than I've ever been. I've regained the ability to appreciate the small things in life, from a particularly well-fitting shirt, to the perfect morning tea at my local cafe. Life's simple pleasures, ones that were so cruelly robbed from me by our digital overlords, or perhaps I willingly gave away, were finally reclaimed.

Goodbye YouTube! Hello World!
