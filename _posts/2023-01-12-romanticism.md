> "The days of days!"

Wrote Charles Darwin in his personal journal on November 11, 1838. No, he was not on the verge of some exciting breakthrough in evolutionary biology; the publication of his theory of natural selection won't be for another 20 years. Instead, he was referring to his proposal to Emma Wedgwood, his charming, cultured, and intelligent cousin; an event perhaps of equal significance to him.

Darwin was a workaholic, and he was not always committed to the idea of marriage. Prior to "the day", Darwin spent 5 years traveling around the world on the ship HMS Beagle. He worked incessantly and his health suffered as a result. At one point, he noted that he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", and was advised by his doctor to stop all work immediately.

A few months prior to his proposal, on April 7, 1838, Darwin mused on the Pros and Cons of marriage. [You can read his journal entries here.](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/tags/about-darwin/family-life/darwin-marriage) What spoke to me wasn't so much the timeless cultural tension between family and career, but the incredibly rational way he approached the question of marriage.



## Marry or Not Marry

Excerpt from Darwin's Journal (formatted slightly to be more readable):

> ***Not Marry***
>
> Freedom to go where one liked— choice of Society & *little of it*. — Conversation of clever men at clubs— Not forced to visit relatives, & to bend in every trifle.— to have the expense & anxiety of children— perhaps quarrelling— Loss of time. — cannot read in the Evenings— fatness & idleness— Anxiety &
> responsibility— less money for books &— if many children forced to gain one’s bread.— (But then it is very bad for ones health to work too much)
>
> ***Marry***
>
> Children—(if it Please God) — Constant companion, (& friend in old age) who will feel interested in one,— object to be beloved & played with.—better than a  dog anyhow.— Home, & someone to take care of house— Charms of music & female chit-chat.— These things good for one’s health.— but terrible loss of time.
>
> My God, it is intolerable to think of spending ones whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working, & nothing after all.— No, no won’t do.— Imagine living all one’s day solitarily in smoky dirty London House.— Only picture to yourself a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music perhaps— Compare this vision with the dingy reality of Grt. Marlbro’ St. 
>
> Marry—Mary—Marry Q.E.D.,

To summarize his journal entry:

<u>Pros of Marriage:</u>

* Children
* Constant companion and friend in old age
* Objective to be loved and played with. Better than a dog anyhow (wow... Darwin!)
* Someone to take care of the house
* Charm of music, female chit-chat which is good for ones health
* Intolerable to think of spending one's life alone, working like a neuter bee.

<u>Cons of Marriage:</u>

* Terrible waste of productive time
* Loss of freedom and flexibility to go where one desires
* Loss of good friends and clever conversations at the club
* Forced to visit relatives
* Perhaps trifle and quarreling
* Expense and anxiety of children
* Cannot read in the evenings. Less money for books
* Fat and idleness

After much deliberation, one thought seemed to be the deciding factor for Darwin:

> My God, it is intolerable to think of spending ones whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working, & nothing after all.

Marry—Mary—Marry Q.E.D.

Let's try to overlook Darwin's gender role bias as credulity of another era, and a sign of our moral progress. This article isn't about the content of Darwin's journal entry anyways! 



## Romanticism

Romanticism, like any other word ending in -ism, is an umbrella term that covers a huge spectrum of ideas in literature, arts, and philosophy. In this case, I am referring to the counter-enlightenment movement in the 18th century. Also known as "Sturm und Drang" in Germany.

In essence, there was a pervasive sense amongst some thinkers at the time that we are relying on reason too much for arriving at knowledge. And that perhaps we should also emphasize "inspiration, subjectivity, and the primacy of the individual". In many ways, Romanticism was a direct refutation of rationalism. Enlightenment ideals such as rationalism simply cannot fully capture the human condition. Over-reliance on reason and science has "devalued beauty, spirit and history in favor of a view of man as a soulless machine and a view of the universe as a meaningless, disenchanted void lacking richness and beauty".

For things like love, marriage, and finding your soulmate, our modern sensitivities tend to scoff at marriage for political or business interests. How could anyone marry for any reason other than love?



## The Pendulum Swings

The impetus for this post came from Tim Urban's amazing article on finding the right partner: [https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html).

> "When you choose a life partner, you’re choosing a lot of things, including your parenting partner and someone who will deeply influence your children, your eating companion for about 20,000 meals, your travel companion for about 100 vacations, your primary leisure time and retirement friend, your career therapist, and someone whose day you’ll hear about 18,000 times" - Tim Urban

We go to school for 4+ years to be an engineer, 10+ years to be a doctor. Yet when it comes to what is arguably the most important decision of our lives... Let's just wing it! Rather than relying on reason for such a momentous decision, we rely on vague emotions and intuition.

On the other end of the spectrum is a loveless marriage, one borne purely out of business or political reasons; which was the case for most of human history. In her 2016 Essay titled "The Radical Idea of Marrying for Love", Stephanie Coontz noted that for most of human history, marrying for love was considered exceedingly rare. The notion that people should get married for romantic reasons was thought of as naïve, perhaps even dangerous. Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" was a warning, not a celebration, of love. Beware! Young and foolish lovers with your fleeting teenage infatuations. Tragedy awaits for those who abandon reason in favor of unbounded passion.

The romantic in me is repulsed by the idea of not marrying for love. Yet the importance of finding the right partner is a solid reminder that it behooves us to keep our wits and strike a balance. Despite our culture's over-correction towards emotion over reason, I'm still a believer in romanticism. If there's any wisdom in "YOLO", it's exactly that... you only live once. Marrying the wrong person and going through a soul-crushing divorce is tragic. But on the other hand, what could be more tragic than a life of regret, a life of "what-if", a life devoid of romantic love that so richly defines the human experience.
