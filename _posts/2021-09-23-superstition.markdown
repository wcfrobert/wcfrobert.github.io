I have always been a big fan of history and philosophy podcasts. One of my all-time favorite is [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/). Anyways, I recently came across an episode on superstition, which I felt was quite eye-opening. We tend to think the days of snake oil salesman and quackery are the gullibility of another era, but it turns out we are not as immune to superstition as we'd like to think.

Youth lotions, antioxidants, amino acids, miracle fruits like pomegranate and acai berry, extracted ketones, biofactors, CBD oil, triple reverse osmosis water, gold-plated HDMI cables, and etc...

If the dictionary definition of superstition is "misattributing some false cause to an effect", then any knowledge we have about the world that is merely correlational is in some ways superstitious. As an engineer who believes e = pi = 3, correlation is enough to be practical and informative. But I've come to appreciate the fact that certainty, in a philosophical sense, is very elusive.

It feels good to have guidance, to not feel lost. Uncertainty and unknown is not comfortable. Much better to outsource our understanding of the world to experts or to some supernatural entity. 

Immanuel Kant wrote this in response to the question: “What is enlightenment”. Quote: 

> “Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity”. - Immanuel Kant 

Immaturity is self-inflicted not from a lack of understanding, but from the lack of courage to use one’s reason, intellect, and wisdom without the guidance of another.
