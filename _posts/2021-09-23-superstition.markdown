After listening to the [Philosophize This Podcast](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) episode on superstition (great podcast by the way!), It had occurred to me that I lived most of my life with an abundance of superstitious thoughts. I thought the days of snake-oil salesman were gone and most of us firmly believes in the scientific method. But I don't think we are immune entirely.

If the dictionary definition of superstition is "misattributing some false cause to an effect", then any knowledge we have about the world that is merely correlational can be thought of as superstition. Although obviously some superstitions are more outrageous than others. And some are harmless and insignificant, while others directly shape how we live our lives.

As an engineer who believes e = pi = 3 (obviously joking), correlation is enough to be practical and informative. But would I be more prone to superstitious thinking? I know the phrase "correlation does not imply causation" gets tossed around, but it is immensely difficult to prove cause and effect.


## Enlightenment

I've been reading some books on start-ups and this thought came to mind.

What separates a formidable individual from a regular person? Better yet, what separates a successful start-up founder from the rest? When faced with one of thousands of setbacks which are all but guaranteed in the early stage of a start-up, do they cower in fear, put a poster of the God of fortune and pray the problem will go away? Or do they face the unknown head on. Dig deep into the root cause to find a solution. It’s a hard job, and it’s why not everyone is an entrepreneur or CEO. It’s much easier and comfortable to just be told what to do each week and meet deadlines and give deliverables to supervisors. Elon Musk said it best: “Running a start-up is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss. After a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never stops.”

I am a big fan of enlightenment thinking. And because of my upbringing, I am naturally allergic to superstitious thinking. How troublesome, to always make sure your shoes face a certain way, to ensure your head aligns South or East when you sleep, to worry about where to put chopsticks, how desks are arranged, what house plant to buy, and etc. What a tormented lifestyle. To live in fear of that which is unknown. To be preoccupied, immobilized with irrationalities, perceived supernatural influence, or fate. To constantly misattribute a false cause to an effect.

I've been thinking about why do people read astrology, palmistry, and things alike. I think it just feels better to be guided, to know there is a reason for everything, to have someone who seem to have all the answer; like a young child with their parents. I know there are tragedies in the world, indiginities and absurdities suffered by those who don't deserve it. Nevertheless, I am a fan of the idea that I am the architect of your life. That I am in control, even if it's an illusion at times.

To end with a quote from Immanuel Kant. He wrote this in response to the question: “What is enlightenment”. Quote: 

> “Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity”. 

Immaturity is self-inflicted not from a lack of understanding, but from the lack of courage to use one’s reason, intellect, and wisdom without the guidance of another.
