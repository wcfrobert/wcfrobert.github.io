I have always been a big fan of history and philosophy podcasts. One of my all-time favorite is a podcast called [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/). Anyways, I recently came across an episode on superstition, which completely changed my views. I had always considered the days of snake-oil salesman and weird superstitions to be bygones. But as it turns out, we are not as immune to superstition as we'd like to think.

If the dictionary definition of superstition is "misattributing some false cause to an effect", then any knowledge we have about the world that is merely correlational is in some ways superstitious. Although obviously not forwarding a chain email is infinitely more superstitious than making correlational observations, but you get my point. As an engineer who believes e = pi = 3, correlation is enough to be practical and informative. But I've come to appreciate the fact that certainty, in a philosophical sense, is very elusive.

That said, I've been thinking about why do people read astrology, palmistry, and things alike. I think it just feels good to be guided. Uncertainty and unknown is not a comfortable position to be in. Much better to outsource our thinking to experts that seem to known everything. To end with a quote from Immanuel Kant. He wrote this in response to the question: “What is enlightenment”. Quote: 

> “Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity”. 

Immaturity is self-inflicted not from a lack of understanding, but from the lack of courage to use one’s reason, intellect, and wisdom without the guidance of another.
