Look I know the title is terrible. It is obviously a play on the Mike Posner's song "A Lonely Night in Mexico Thinking About Big Sean and Avicii". Great song by the way, it's the 16th and final track on his Album "Keep Going".

## Friedrich Nietzsche

Friedrich Nietzsche was a 19th century German philosopher who needs no introduction. Most attribute his writing to that of a nihilist. I don't study philosophy so I can't really comment either way. What I can say though, is that I am a big fan of his idea of self-overcoming, will to power, ubermensch, death of moral objectivity (i.e. death of god). Here are some of my favorite Nietzsche quotes:

> "The secret of realizing the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment of existence is: to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships out into uncharted seas! Live in conflict with your equals and with yourselves! Be robbers and ravagers as soon as you ca not be rulers and owners, you men of knowledge! The time will soon past when you could be content to live concealed in the woods like timid deer!"

> "To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities—I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth of anything or not—that one endures"

> "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster."

> "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"

> "There are no facts, only interpretations."

> “I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous — a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite.”



## Emil Cioran Quotes

Emil Cioran was a 20th century Romanian philosopher and essayist well known for his philosophical pessimism and his work regarding suffering, decay, and nihilism. I am not a pessimist, nor am I in a state of deep despair, nor have I studied any of Cioran's work at any depth. I just happen to enjoy some of his quotes. It's provocative.

> "It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late."

> "The fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live - moreover, the only one."

> "Only optimists commit suicide, optimists who no longer succeed at being optimists. The others, having no reason to live, why would they have any to die?"

> “What do you do from morning to night?" "I endure myself.”
